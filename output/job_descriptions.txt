Description:
I’m looking for a creative, experienced AI specialist to help me build and understand a multi-agent AI ecosystem for my startup. Initially, I want to start small by creating multiple chat-based “agents” (likely using ChatGPT) for different aspects of my business. Over time, I’d like to expand this setup to include more advanced integrations, such as LangChain, and ultimately develop a highly automated, AI-driven workflow.

What I’m Looking For:
	•	Technical Proficiency: You should be comfortable with ChatGPT, AI agent orchestration tools, and be knowledgeable about LangChain or similar frameworks. Experience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or vector databases is a plus, but not required right away.
	•	Teaching Skills: I’m looking for someone who can guide me through the process. I’m proficient with ChatGPT and technology in general, but I’m not deeply technical. You should be patient, communicative, and able to explain complex concepts simply.
	•	A Passion for Thinking Differently: I value innovative problem-solvers who can help me approach workflows and automations in new ways. I’m not looking for a cookie-cutter solution—I want to explore and learn what’s possible.
	•	Portfolio or Demonstration Video: Preference will be given to candidates who can provide a short video demonstrating a past project they’ve built—showcasing how you integrated multiple AI agents, used LangChain, or automated tasks with AI. This can be a screen recording with a voiceover explanation.

Responsibilities:
	1.	Initial Setup: Help design and configure multiple AI “agents” (e.g., separate chats or integrated solutions) for different facets of the business (operations, marketing, development support, etc.).
	2.	Integration Roadmap: Develop a phased plan to move from simple chat-based agents to a more complex workflow that might include LangChain and other advanced tool integrations.
	3.	Tutoring & Guidance: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and live tutoring sessions (via Zoom or similar platform) to teach me how to manage, update, and maintain these workflows independently.
	4.	Ongoing Support: Offer guidance on best practices, potential tools, and upgrades as needed.

To Apply:
	•	Please briefly describe your experience with AI agents, ChatGPT, and any relevant frameworks (like LangChain).
	•	Mention your experience in teaching or tutoring non-technical individuals.
	•	Include a link to a short video demonstration if possible. This can be a new recording or something you’ve prepared previously.

This is an exciting opportunity for someone who loves to think outside the box, build intuitive AI workflows, and empower a founder to become more self-sufficient in managing them. I look forward to collaborating with you!

Overview

The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent framework integrates reasoning and dynamic actions to create intelligent, adaptive systems. Implementing this model in JavaScript, particularly within a Node.js environment, enables seamless integration with APIs, databases, and external tools, making it an ideal choice for building flexible and scalable conversational AI systems.

This document outlines the concept, architecture, and implementation plan for developing a ReAct agent using JavaScript.

Objectives

Dynamic Decision-Making: Enable agents to reason through complex tasks and act accordingly.

API Integration: Provide out-of-the-box support for querying APIs, databases, and custom tools.

Scalability: Design a flexible framework suitable for multi-turn conversations and task automation.

Modularity: Support plug-and-play functionality for different task modules.


Key Features

1. Reasoning Loop

Uses OpenAI’s API to generate reasoning steps and decide actions.

Dynamically adapts to user inputs and changing contexts.

2. Action Execution

Executes actions based on the reasoning output, including:

API calls

Database queries

Scheduling tasks

3. Iterative Context Management

Maintains a “context” that logs reasoning, actions, and observations.

Allows multi-turn conversations and dynamic task progression.

4. Modular Task Handling

Supports task-specific modules (e.g., scheduling, information retrieval).

Allows easy addition of new capabilities without altering the core framework.

5. Scalability and Extensibility

Designed to support multiple concurrent users with minimal overhead.

Easily extendable to integrate new APIs and functionalities.


Architecture

Core Components

Input Handler:

Captures user input and initiates the reasoning process.

Reasoning Engine:

Uses the OpenAI API to generate reasoning and determine the next action.

Example Output:

Thought: The user wants to schedule a meeting.
Action: Call the scheduling API with the provided date and time.

Action Executor:

Executes the specified actions, such as:

Querying APIs (e.g., scheduling, weather data).

Accessing databases.

Context Manager:

Logs and updates the context after each reasoning-action-observation cycle.

Ensures continuity across multi-turn interactions.

Response Generator:

Compiles the final output based on the results of actions and context.

Data Flow

User Input → Input Handler

Context + Input → Reasoning Engine

Reasoning Output → Action Executor

Action Results → Context Manager

Updated Context → Response Generator → User 


Please, bid only on this Job, if you are knowledge on such systems developments of ReAct Agents.

Is this cost scalable as user demand grows?

Maintenance and Improvements:

Can the solution be designed for ongoing maintenance and improvements?

Will you handle maintaining/updating these agents over time as partner websites evolve?

Deliverables:

Proof of concept:

Develop a prototype agent for one partner website to demonstrate feasibility. (eg: https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/ )

Scalable solution:

Develop agents for all partner websites, working asynchronously.

API endpoints:

Build and document endpoints for activating the agents with user parameters.

	•	Manager Agent:
	•	Oversees the process, ensuring quality, coherence, and alignment with the goal.
	•	Proofreader Agent:
	•	Reviews the final emails for grammar, flow, and polish.
I’m open to suggestions on how to best structure these roles for efficiency and quality.
	3.	Output:
	•	First Email:
	•	Introduces the book, highlights key takeaways, tells an engaging story, and provides value.
	•	Includes a call-to-action trigger link encouraging readers to opt into a multi-part email series for a deeper dive.

I just a need an autonomous AI agent to manage X accounts. I'm a former dev. I can use a CLI to train the agent's specific personality and objectives. The agent needs to be able to create content intelligently, respond to comments/mentions/DMs, analyze performance, and engage the community.  I will provide you with the agent's handle and API keys. It should also be able to DM me with any questions or requests as its human surrogate. 

You should already have this built and be able to deploy it quickly. I'm paying $5,000 for the work you've already done. Nothing I need is very bespoke. I will provide an AWS account. I'll make everything as easy as possible. If it goes well, I'll keep paying you a flat rate per agent, even if it takes you 5 minutes to deploy. 

Bonus if it can connect to other social media platforms.
Mega bonus if it can manage it's own Solana or Ethereum wallets.

Objective:
Optimize the technical aspects of Agente Imóvel’s website to improve organic search performance, recover lost traffic, and enhance domain authority. Focus on technical elements such as site structure, core web vitals, indexing issues, mobile optimization, and backlink strategies to drive traffic growth.

Key Responsibilities:
Technical SEO Optimization:

Indexing & Crawl Issues:
Resolve the large discrepancy between indexed and non-indexed pages (2,244,675 non-indexed vs. 187,958 indexed). Prioritize high-value pages for indexing, identify and consolidate duplicate content, and remove any irrelevant or low-quality pages.
Implement XML sitemap updates to ensure proper crawling and indexing of the most important pages. Ensure the sitemap reflects the site’s evolving content structure.
Fix Core Web Vitals:
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Improve LCP to under 2.5 seconds, focusing on optimizing page load time, particularly for content-heavy pages like property listings and valuation tools.
First Input Delay (FID): Improve FID (or Interaction to Next Paint - INP) to ensure pages are interactive within 100 milliseconds, addressing any JavaScript or rendering issues.
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Reduce CLS below 0.1 by ensuring that layout shifts during loading are minimized (e.g., by using size attributes for images and video elements).
Ongoing Core Web Vitals Monitoring: Continuously monitor Core Web Vitals using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights and Semrush, and make adjustments to keep the site optimized.
Mobile Optimization:
Focus on improving the mobile version of the site. Ensure that it meets mobile-first indexing guidelines and that mobile-specific issues are addressed, such as slow load times, interactivity problems, and content layout issues.
Implement responsive design best practices and prioritize mobile usability enhancements.
HTTPS Optimization:
Confirm that all pages across the site are fully HTTPS compliant (currently no non-HTTPS pages).
Ensure security settings are correct and SSL certificates are valid for all subdomains.
Internal Site Structure & Navigation:

Site Architecture Optimization:
Ensure the site has a clear and logical structure, with URLs following a consistent, SEO-friendly format.
Address issues with duplicate URLs and poor internal linking, ensuring that the internal linking structure reflects the site’s key priorities.
Improve breadcrumb navigation for both SEO and user experience.
Structured Data Markup:
Enhance existing structured data (e.g., breadcrumbs, FAQ, review snippets) and ensure proper implementation of JSON-LD. Review current structured data implementation to ensure it’s parsable and error-free.
Expand structured data coverage to key pages, including product pages, blog posts, and valuation tools, to increase the chances of rich snippets in search results.
Backlink & Link Profile Management:

Backlink Profile Health Check:
Perform a comprehensive backlink audit to identify and disavow any harmful or toxic backlinks that might be affecting site performance and rankings.
Focus on improving the quality of backlinks by reaching out for high-authority link placements in the real estate and proptech industry. Aim for links from authoritative domains.
Monitor backlinks regularly and use tools like Semrush to identify lost links and any opportunities to earn new high-quality backlinks.
Broken Link Recovery:
Identify broken links across the site and implement redirects to ensure that users and search engines do not encounter 404 pages, which can harm rankings.
Use Semrush’s Backlink Analytics to identify any broken backlinks from authoritative websites, and attempt to reclaim these links.
Performance & Speed Optimization:

Site Speed Improvements:
Focus on enhancing page load speeds across all pages. Target improvements in image sizes, JavaScript execution, and server response times.
Implement caching and content delivery networks (CDNs) to speed up page load times, especially for users in different geographical regions.

Hi there! I'm an aspiring children's book author, mama of 2, and an ex-advertising executive. I am working on a picture book that addresses what it means to be human in the age of AI, featuring a little girl and a robot at the beach. 

I've worked with an editor on a near-finished manuscript  (32 pages, 200 words), now searching for an illustrator to help develop sample visuals (3 full page spreads) for my book. I am looking for someone with experience in picture book illustrations with a photo-real style.

For context, I'll be using these visuals to give a sense of what my book is about as I pitch to book agents and then publishers. I have about 6 weeks to do so. Please let me know if this sounds like something you would be interested in working on with me. I'll share manuscript, art notes, illustration specs, and timing with selected partner.

I need help creating this Chatbot on ZenDesk. 

I tried, but it’s actually a lot more confusing than I wanted, so I need help.

I’d like this bot to give me a simple calculation for an epoxy services website. The bot should get answers to two questions.

How many square feet is your garage?
Do they want their walls painted as well?

Also, it should lead in with the first question to get started. It's only for this quote purposes, not customer service. I'm going to embed it on the webiste 

Based on that answer, the bot should give them a quote. Here’s how to calculate.

$9 square foot for epoxy (flakes)
$1.66 square foot for painting

So a 600 square foot garage would be $9 x 600 + painting their walls which is $1.66 * 600 which equals $6,396.

Before we give them the quote, we ask for their name & email address.

After their name & email. The bot will give them the answer of $6,396.

Then this way, they get the quote, we capture customer information in ZenDesk and we can figure out what to do from there for marketing, customer service, etc. 

I'll need a bunch more help for zendesk as I go along as well. 

If I select you, i'll get you access. let me know in as few words as possible why you think yuo can get this done. any real life examples is best on Zendesk.

I'm looking for a development team to create me a simple version of an OHM (OlympusDAO) fork (see link at bottom for example) with monetary policy that's decided on by an AI agent.

Planning to do this on Solana.
So would need a 2-pronged development approach:
- the basic smart contract functionality - launching a token, having staking and rewards, bonding functionality
- a website UI that allows people to interact with the smart contracts (stake/bond/claim token rewards)
- an AI agent that can be trained to make decisions based on the economy and express in words what changes they are making and why - this can be rather gimmicky. We can train it pretty simply to begin with, and we as the humans can just implement the policy based on what the AI tells us using a dashboard - later integrating the AI to actually interact with the smart contracts.
I want something very basic initially (what I've outlined above but no extras) as time of delivery is important. Following that, we'd create extra projects to build out the product with more advanced functionality.

While I said OHM fork above, I want a simplified version. This: https://retardedapr.com/ is better representative of the functionality I'm looking for.

Timeframe is important as things move fast in crypto. If you could provide me with a very rough quote (fixed delivery amount) and timeline I'd appreciate it, and we can talk further from there.
Budget is flexible, and fully funded.

Looking to start within a week.

I am looking for someone who can help me automate part of my content creation process through a multi ai agent system.
I am open to work on n8n, note.com or crew ai.
The idea is having different ai agent that will focus on different parts of the process and perform different task. Some of them will have specific internal knowledge on the task, goals, guidelines, etc (I have some document already created for them).

The end goal is to provide the system a reference document in which the content will be based on. On top of that they will have to make some extra research (usually a combination of internet, provided images containing text, other pappers, etc). Base on all the research information (and given our specify tone, goal, etc) it will generate a document that will be the final reference for all the content.
From there it will generate a video, script, another ai agent (or various) will decide what pieces of content to create and when to post in each social media platform from an existing list of option, the same goes for products to sell, etc.
It will generateall the output required and wait for my approval for posting. So it mos likelly will use an airtable or similar.

This is just a super brief description on what's the task about. I'm leaving out a lot of the ai agents I need. I will provide more deatils to the right candidate. 

So, I need someone who can create a video tutorial on how to do this and provide a copy of the template so that I can just copy it in the platform and adapt it to my needs.
So please, base on the provided information, suggest how to do this (platform, etc), how long will it take you and price.

If it helps, what I need is a bit of a mix between the following 2 video. Not exactly anu of the 2 but a good starting point:

Project Overview:

We are building an AI-driven voice agent platform designed to assist businesses in managing customer calls. Our goal is to create a seamless, human-like interaction for users, where the AI can handle tasks such as answering calls, providing information, transferring calls to the right departments, and ending calls in a smooth, natural way.

We’ve already made significant progress in building the platform, but we're currently facing several challenges that need to be addressed in order to make the voice agent more effective and user-friendly.

The Issues We're Facing:

1. Call Transfer:
Objective: The AI should be able to understand the user’s intent to transfer a call and trigger the appropriate action.
Action Needed:
Implement intent recognition to detect when a call should be transferred (e.g., to a human agent or another department).
Ensure seamless integration with your backend to handle the transfer process and notify users clearly.
Handle this with clear WebSocket events (e.g., callUpdate) to detect and manage call transfer states.
2. End Call:
Objective: The AI should recognize when a conversation should end and do so with a dynamic and human-like message.
Action Needed:
Improve intent classification for ending calls. The AI should be able to identify phrases or cues that indicate a conversation is finished.
Allow dynamic closing messages that feel natural, such as “Thank you for your time, have a great day!” or “If you need further assistance, feel free to call us anytime!”
3. Smooth, Natural Conversation (Avoid AI-like Sounds):
Objective: Ensure the AI speaks naturally without sounding robotic.
Action Needed:
Enhance speech synthesis using advanced voice models like those from Deepgram or similar solutions that allow for more human-like, emotional tone variations.
Incorporate appropriate pauses and intonation, making the conversation sound fluid and realistic. This is especially important when responding to long pauses or complex queries.
4. Ambient Sound:
Objective: Include background sounds (such as phone line noise or environment-specific sounds) to make the interaction more human-like and immersive.
Action Needed:
Integrate ambient sound or background noise options that can be triggered to simulate a more natural conversation environment.
Ensure the sound doesn’t overpower the conversation but adds subtle realism to the call experience.
5. Intent Classification:
Objective: Enhance the AI’s ability to accurately understand and classify the user's intent (e.g., transferring a call, ending a conversation, making an inquiry, etc.).
Action Needed:
Refine the NLP models to better handle intent detection.
Use machine learning models to continuously improve the accuracy of understanding different user requests based on context.
6. Turn-Taking Model:
Objective: The AI should engage in conversation naturally, knowing when to speak and when to pause for the user’s input.
Action Needed:
Implement a turn-taking model that ensures the AI knows when to respond and when to wait for the user to speak. This would make the conversation flow more naturally and help avoid interruptions or awkward pauses.
This model can also help in situations where multiple people are interacting with the AI simultaneously or when there’s a shift in who is speaking.

Project Overview: Video Demonstration of an AI-Powered Innovation Workshop App

Objective

Create a video showcasing an AI application that automates an innovation workshop through multi-agent collaboration. The goal is to demonstrate how the app simulates the roles of key workshop participants and produces actionable results.

Project Context

The application operates by simulating a multi-agent innovation workshop. It features four key agents, each fulfilling a specific role:
	•	Brand Manager: Ensures alignment with the brand’s identity and goals.
	•	Market Research Consultant: Analyzes consumer needs and market trends.
	•	Creative Director: Develops innovative ideas for new product features.
	•	Market Administrator: Evaluates feasibility and market positioning.

Inputs: Simple information such as brand (e.g., Apple), product (e.g., iPhone), and target audience (e.g., AI enthusiasts).
Process: Each agent autonomously performs tasks, including gathering data, generating ideas, and documenting results, replicating a real innovation workshop.

Visual Format

To bring this concept to life, the video will adopt a photo comic-style format, which includes:
	•	Static images with subtle animations (e.g., blinking, slight movements) to minimize editing workload.
	•	Comic-style text bubbles to depict dialogues and interactions between the agents.

Mission Breakdown

Illustrating Agent Interactions

The video will depict a sequence of actions showcasing how the agents collaborate. Key scenes include:
	1.	Setup and Input:
	•	Display a computer screen with simple inputs: “Apple,” “iPhone,” “AI enthusiasts.”
	•	The system generates the four agents and introduces their roles.
	2.	Agent Workflow:
	•	Brand Manager: Creates a strategic brief based on inputs.
	•	Strategic Planner: Searches the web for relevant iPhone features, autonomously reads articles, and gathers insights.
	•	Market Researcher: Identifies insights about AI enthusiasts and summarizes findings.
	•	Market Administrator: Compiles a marketing strategy using the “why, who, what, how” framework.
	•	Creative Director: Receives the augmented brief, generates ideas using brainstorming techniques, and collaborates with other agents.
	•	Market Administrator: Documents ideas and prepares a summary.
	•	Brand Manager: Rates ideas based on strategic fit, uniqueness, and business impact.
	3.	Output Documentation:
	•	The Market Administrator finalizes the workshop outcome with prioritized ideas.
	4.	Quick Repeat Sequence:
	•	Show the same workflow at 5x speed with a different input (e.g., “Land Rover,” “Defender,” “cycling enthusiasts”), highlighting how the app generates new results for different scenarios.
	5.	Closing Scene:
	•	Introduce the robot and Bexaga Lab branding to conclude the video.

Expected Deliverables

	•	A 1–2 minute video designed for LinkedIn, incorporating:
	•	Static visuals with light animations.
	•	Text bubbles illustrating interactions.
	•	Branded closing segment.

Resources Provided

	•	Photos of the main characters.
	•	Sample outcomes for iPhone and Land Rover Defender.
	•	The Bexaga Lab logo and robot icon.

Let's say we want to create a list of all Spanish olive oil suppliers.

Right now we're: 
1) typing that keyword in google manually, 
2) looking for directories, 
3) scraping them, 
4) combining the results from various ones, 
5) then finding the URL of the companies, 
6) and the email addresses, 
7) then sending them an email to ask for the product prices.

That takes hours and several team members.

There must be a way to automate all of that. 
When asking ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity/Gemini, perhaps the first list of 10 companies is going to be good, but then if we ask it to add 20 additional companies, it returns a list of fake ones with fake names/websites that are 404 and phone numbers that don't exist,

So we're open to other ways of doing this, perhaps with Zapier/Make etc..?

Or perhaps several AI Agents working together? Ideally they would continue working until they've pieced together the whole list of manufacturers

2) Look up the weather for Berlin (the capital of Germany).
3) Extract the current weather data in a JSON format.

Framework Overview
The CrewAI framework is widely supported and commonly used. (https://www.crewai.com/)
The project is open source and available at https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI.
The new agent will integrate into an AI agency with agents designed for software development. These agents will form a SCRUM team for general-purpose coding tasks. Use the CrewAI framework to build the browsing agent and related tools, adhering to its structural conventions.Examples and references: https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools
Additionally, you may reference my prior experience with AI agents for software development in my own framework: https://github.com/com2u/CrewAI_Framework/blob/main/WebDevelopment_SCRUM_Crew.py

I have SOME copy, and a first version of the home page, but just overall not satisfied. 

Here is the full saas, its a saas platform similar to POE or YOU.com where its a hub for all different AI platforms. Right now its all LLMs, but in near future we'll house all audio, image, and any other generative AI api's available on market, as well as include templates, agents, tools, etc. 

Here's the figma, the branding should still match the app's UI and the overall branding: https://www.figma.com/design/h6EM3fr5VRfAhlv68ykGk5/Panels-AI?node-id=0-1&t=kmPDlZXdNPz8eUmk-1

Here's the rough first version of home page, its not bad, but i'm not in love with it either: https://wordpress-1298350-4875806.cloudwaysapps.com/ 

And here's some of the copy and examples put together. You can see current version is based on this page up to the "dev stop here" note: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YFFHbK3EInhmi2oI2TA6Fmkgmkdix5hQf5DPZaX3sk4/edit?usp=sharing


The positioning isn't quite ideal. The main differentiator is that all these chat apps all require a monthly subscription to get the best models, we're a pay as you go at our core. 

We do have a monthly version, and its cheaper credts (that expire). But the goal isn't to be known as another monthly chat app, but rather as a "no minimum and no monthly required" type of app. 

Would be great to account for future expansion of all Gen AI mediums, but for now its just the LLMs. 

You should be great at making a high converting SAAS home/landing page. 

And also at least fluent enough in copywriting and copy structure to make sure the copy & home page flow well, and also acheive our goal. 

This should be a completed page, so if you need to get screenshots for gifs, or videos, or otherwise from the app, please do that during the design. 

In order to be considered, send EXACTLY 1 or 2 examples of saas home pages you've recently designed. If you send more, or less, you will be immediately be deleted.

Cooperative Agents for Data Analysis
This project aims to train two LLM (Large Language Model) agents to cooperate in solving data analysis problems. The training environment is customized, where agents must learn to collaborate to maximize rewards. The solution requires two types of agents: one to write the initial code and another to review and suggest improvements. The reviewer identifies errors and proposes refinements, while the coder addresses feedback and improves the code iteratively.

Agent Design
Instead of training a single agent to tackle the entire problem, the complexity of data analysis makes it more efficient to divide tasks between two agents. This task specialization improves training efficiency and solution convergence. Each agent operates within a finite and well-defined action space, and short-term memory facilitates communication and decision-making.

1. Coding Agent

Role: Writes the code to perform data analysis tasks.
Action Space:
Data Processing: Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.
Data Analysis: Conduct statistical analysis or build machine learning models.
Visualization: Create graphs and visualizations of the results.
Result Interpretation: Produce explanatory text integrating figures and tables.
2. Reviewing Agent

Role: Reviews the code and provides feedback for improvement.
Action Space:
Static Analysis: Use tools like Mypy, Ruff, and Bandit to evaluate the code.
Code Execution: Run the code to verify correctness and identify bugs.
Refactoring Suggestions: Propose ways to improve code quality.
Code Approval: Approve the code as correct and high-quality.
Report Improvement: Enhance the quality of an analytical report by refining an existing version.
Training Environment
The environment provides a context where agents interact and learn. The goal is to produce an analytical report that meets predefined quality and accuracy criteria. To support this, the environment can:

Execute code to identify bugs and correctness.
Evaluate code quality using linters and complexity analysis.
Compute the analytical report's score based on quality metrics.
Provide rewards or penalties based on code quality and correctness.
Generate prompts to guide the reviewing agent in giving constructive feedback.
Rewards and Penalties
Coding Agent:
Reward: Positive for correct, high-quality code.
Penalty: Negative for buggy or low-quality code.
Reviewing Agent:
Reward: Positive when report scores improve after feedback.
Training Workflow
Initial Problem Setup: The environment introduces the problem through prompts that include task descriptions and agent roles. For example:
Coder Prompt: "Write a script to clean sales data from 'sales_data.csv' by correcting formatting errors."
Reviewer Prompt: "Review the cleaning script for errors and suggest improvements for efficiency."
Execution and Feedback Loop:
The coding agent takes an action (e.g., writes or modifies code).
The environment evaluates the code for bugs and correctness, returning rewards or penalties.
The reviewing agent analyzes the code and provides feedback in the form of actionable suggestions.
Both agents iteratively refine the code and report until a target quality threshold is achieved.
Evaluation and Scoring
The analytical report is scored across five sections:

Problem Description (clarity and accuracy).
Data Description (completeness, quality analysis, visualization).
Methodology (approach, justification, implementation).
Results (accuracy, interpretation, visualization).
Conclusion (summary, implications, recommendations).
Each section is scored on a 10-point scale for multiple criteria, with a total possible score of 150. The task is complete when the report score reaches or exceeds 135 points (90%).

Actor-Critic Framework
The training uses the actor-critic approach:

Actor (Work Agent): Writes and refines the analytical report.
Critic (Feedback Agent): Evaluates the report, scores it, and provides detailed feedback to improve it.
Reward Function:
Normalized score: normalized_score = total_score / 150.
Both agents receive rewards proportional to their performance in improving the report.
LLM Execution Options
To execute the LLMs, we can use the Hugging Face Transformers library. Another alternative is the Ollama platform, which provides an optimized environment for running and deploying LLMs efficiently.

This system ensures collaborative problem-solving, leveraging feedback-driven iterations to produce high-quality analytical reports.

Propvestor is a real estate consulting and advisory firm focused on helping part-time and passive investors invest in real estate assets.   The platform is being created to give investors all the tools they need to become successful real estate investors.  This includes education & tools listed below.
We want to launch the website in phases with the first phase focused on a landing page with educational videos and general information about how we are and what we do.  The goal is to get visitors to leave their name and contact information.

The website is a scription based website that gives investors the following tools below to succeed.  We are open to build this completely custom or develop it on a platform like GO HIGH LEVEL.  We want to discuss both options and learn the advantages and disadvantages of both.  Here are the tools we want to give our subscribers

Website:  Each subscriber will have their own website on our platform as a sub-domain.  We will have a few website templates (that will grow over time) subscribers can use to market their real estate business.  This website can be standard with a few customizations like, contact information, company name, and logo.  The goal is to give them a proven website that converts leads.

Funnel:  The website will attach to a funnel that will capture and qualify lead information and connect to a CRM

CRM with Calendar:  The website and funnel will be supported by a CRM.  The goal of the CRM is to help them organize their business.  We want to make this easy to use.  The CRM will have Contacts, Leads, Deals.  The CRM should allow for some automation of task and attach to Social Media accounts.  The calendar function is important to keep track of appointments and schedules.

Online Ad’s:  These are ads approved by us they can run on Social Media to gain business.  They can run this on their page or use Pay Per Click (PPC) ads.  This are proven ads that show they can convert.  We also want to provide daily content they can choose to repost on their website if they so choose.

Document Vault:  We will have a vault of documents the subscribers will have access to.  This will include but not limited to Leases, Termination of Lease, 48 Hour notice to enter premises, contracts etc..  We will continuously add documents to this vault to help provide value for our clients. 

Property Evaluator Softwares:  This is our proprietary software that allows subscribers to evaluate real estate opportunities.  The subscriber will simply fill in the appropriate information and the system gives them a breakdown of how the deal looks financially.  They will have to log into the website to access the evaluators.  We will have different evaluators for different property types.  We want to keep this online access only.

Contacts & Relationships:  We are always expanding our contacts and relationships.  We want to share our vetted contacts with the group to help them facilitate real estate transactions.  These include – real estate agents, contractors, title company, cash investors, property managers and others

Portfolio Management / Bookkeeping:  Subscribers will be able to login into the website and view a financial snapshot of their entire portfolio and view financials of each property they own to  see how it is performing. The software will rely on estimated value assumptions that can be put in by the owner, but the income and expense will be accurate and they can get an idea of how their portfolio is performing.  We want to allow good bookkeeping so they are prepared to submit information to CPA for taxes.  We want them to also be able to print balance sheet, cash flow statements, Income Statements.  This should connect with CRM to pull relevant information

Profile:  Clients and Affiliates will be able to create a profile and interact with other members of the community.

Posting in the Community:  Clients and affiliates will be able to post opportunities in the community that are vetted by management.  This will help them build their business and from potential partnerships within the community.  

VestorBox: Subscribers can submit vetted deals to the community and create a profile for the property.  Vestorbox should be a smaller limited version of Investorlift.com and Ark7.com.  The purpose of the website is to showcase and market vetted properties to our subscribers and affiliates and not the community at large.

The Main Website (Provestor.co)
The main website is created to showcase us as a community of real estate investors transforming our lives through real estate investment.  We are a movement.  I want the website to be very engaging showcasing who we are, what we do, and the people we are impacting.  The website will discuss of subscription models and pricing and will be the main page subscribers have to visit in order to login to the website.

There will be several user types to our website and not all of them will be subscribers.   Some of them will be affiliates.  Below is a list of user types for the website.

Beginner Investor: The beginner investor is one that either lacks the credit profile to buy property on their own, the funds needed as a down payment for a property purchase or both.  These are clients we will attract through our eco-system.  We want to work with these clients to help them gain what they lack in order to be able to acquire real estate.

Accredited Investor:  The accredited investor is one that meets the net worth requirements of $2,000,000 net worth and can invest in all Propvestor sponsored projects.  The accredited investor may have credit challenges and may not be able to buy property on their own at the moment.  However, most accredited investors meet the threshold for novice investor in the since they have the funds and credit to acquire property on their own.

Novice investor:  We classify a novice investor as one that has the desire to invest but they are not qualified to invest for Propvestor sponsored projects as an accredited investor because they do not meet the threshold of $2,000,000 net worth.  These investors are qualified to purchase their own investments and we assist them with acquiring their own assets to purchase.  These clients are our primary clients

Active Investor:  An Active investor is one that is currently investing in real estate either part-time or full-time.  Active investors may look to become a client to diversify their real estate portfolio or invest with us on a particular project.  Active investors may or may not be accredited investors. 
Another important note about active investors is they may have transactions they want to market to our group.

Real Estate Developers:  We partner with real estate developers to help them sell existing inventory to our clients.  We also partner with real estate developers to build Propvestor sponsored projects.  We get a lot of our inventory from real estate developers.   Many of these developers have stalled projects or need committed buyers before a bank will lend them the money to build a project.  We help developers by bringing our qualified novice and accredited investors to their projects.

Affiliates
An affiliate is someone who is not a client but works with us to help service a client or introduces us to potential clients and/or properties for us and/or our clients.

Affiliate Types
Real Estate Brokers/Agents:  We work with real estate brokers to find deals that make sense for our clients and deals that make sense for Propvestor direct investment

Real Estate Lenders:  Lenders of real estate help our clients qualify for loans, they fund Propvestor sponsored projects and they can also refer potential deals to Propvestor for client investment or Propvestor direct investment

Real Estate Contractors: Contractors rehab and build projects for Propvestor and our clients.  They can also be an excellent source of knowledge and information about construction cost and nuances with construction sites.  Contractors usually work directly with developers and can be an excellent lead or referral source for projects we may be interested in.

Attorneys:  Attorneys are critical to our operation.  In addition to being an excellent referral source, attorneys are needed for many real estate transactions (depending on state), evictions, agreements, etc. 

Title Companies:  Title companies are needed for title insurance. All real estate closings need title companies.  Propvestor uses and refers our clients to reputable title insurance companies.
Some of these companies will be affiliates and some will just be contacts.  The main difference is the amount of access they are grant to the website.  All affiliates will need to be vetted to protect the interest of our investment community.

Social Media
Social Media and content creation is a huge part of what we do.  The goal is to continuously post on social media platforms and drive traffic back to our websites.  We will create funnels for Propvestor to sell our system to others.  Social Media needs to be a huge part of our website.  

Organic Marketing
We want to work on growing our organization’s organically through the following social media channels.  The goal is to attract both clients and affiliates. 
1.	Facebook
2.	Instagram
3.	Linkedin
4.	Tik Tok
5.	X (formally Twitter)
6.	Youtube

We are looking to create content on a weekly basis that can be broken down into short videos.  These videos will give us daily content that will be promoted on all social media platforms.  We need our system to monitor the success of each post and engage with people that comment or show interest.  Moreover, our page needs to advertise who we are, what we do, and where to find us on the web.  The content will cover an array of topics pertaining to real estate, business, life, and mindset.  We want to keep the content broad so we speak directly to our audience.  The goal is to create engaging content that makes people want to follow us and learn more about us online.
In order to get them to leave their information, we are offering a free e-book followed by an upsell offer to purchase and become a member to our site.  This will be in the form of a funnel.  The goal is to capture their email and mobile number.  They will be added to our drip campaign.  We want to incorporate AI into this portion of the business to help develop emails rich with content and information. The goal is to eventually give offers to them and help them stay engaged.  

Drip campaigns will be based on the client type.  Beginner Investors will have a different email drip than novice investor.  We want the email campaign to speak to their different needs and desires.

SMS will be used to communicate special offers and events we have coming up.

Outbound Marketing

PPC:  We want to create a PPC campaign that has an offer and a funnel page.  We want to market this on the appropriate platforms.  We want to incorporate AI here once people accept the offer and leave their information.

Affiliate Program
We want to create a referral and affiliate program that allows members to share our content on their social media pages and promote our products and services.  We if there refer a member or a subscriber.  We will give them a referral fee and discounted subscription membership.  This is a way to spread the word about what we do organically.

Automation & AI
We are looking to use artificial intelligence in our system and will be using chatbots for inbound and outbound marketing efforts.  We need a system that will allow for these integrations.

Project Overview
SDRCloud.AI is developing an AI-powered communication dashboard to manage and track outbound calls, texts, and emails for integration into our multi tenant platfrom. The system will integrate with Twilio, Dialogflow, and GPT models to handle multiple communication types dynamically. This initial build will lay foundational components for an eventual migration to a multi-tenant platform.

Future Multi-Tenant Migration
While this initial solution is designed as a single-tenant platform, we plan to migrate it to a multi-tenant architecture. Development should account for this by following modular, scalable design principles, ensuring data and API handling are tenant-aware, and keeping sensitive data secure and isolated. Documentation on extensibility and tenant-specific configurations is crucial to support future expansion.

We have a fairly large dataset of vehicles sold at auction. It includes several characteristics like year, make, model, trim, engine size, title condition, type of damage, etc. We add about 60,000 vehicles per week to this database (currently in MySQL). So right now let's say there are about 3 million records in the past year. We'd like our agents who make offers to customers to be able to input a few details, and the AI model would output the predicted auction amount. Right now, our system just displays the closest matching vehicles with their sales prices, and the agent uses that to determine a reasonable amount based on their own expertise and industry background. So the goal is to use AI to eliminate the agent's "best guess" looking at the recent trends.

I am an expert backend developer, but I have no expertise in machine learning. So I want to work closely with someone who can explain the process and provide solid communication and timely updates. This system may grow and become more even more refined if it is successful. For example, we would possibly perfect the model by restricting it by region and favoring more recent data. But for now, please propose a solid proposal based on simply the input of the parameters (year make model condition) and outputting the best predicted price.

_____________

I am looking for an experienced freelance web developer to create a comprehensive web platform (including both frontend and backend) that enables users to create fully customisable chatbots for both text and voice interactions. The platform should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily build chatbots powered by multiple knowledge sources, such as PDFs, Word documents, text files, YouTube videos, MP3s, FAQs, and more. Chatbots will support white-label customisation, enabling users to add their own branding elements like logos and colours.

Key integrations will include:

Twilio: for speech-to-speech phone interactions, where users input their own API keys for direct connection.
Zapier and Cal.com: to automate workflows and integrate with calendar services.
Together.ai API: to power the chatbot’s AI capabilities, with an initial consideration for the cost-effective Llama 3.2 11B model, though alternative models may be explored.
ElevenLabs: for a high-quality voice interface, supporting natural and expressive responses.
The platform will feature subscription plans (Basic, Premium, and Custom) with tiered functionality. For example, only Premium users will have access to voice integration and YouTube/MP3 knowledge uploading.

Administrators will have a backend dashboard for monitoring platform activity, including subscription statuses, sales, API usage, and revenue/cost metrics. A customer support ticketing system will also be incorporated, allowing users to request assistance directly through the platform.

The website’s design will feature a clean, light-coloured interface with a simple logo, and will include an embedded chatbot on the homepage to assist visitors and showcase the platform’s capabilities.

In summary, this platform will provide a seamless and flexible experience for creating and managing personalised, voice-enabled chatbots across a wide array of applications.

The platform must be user-friendly and allow for the creation of chatbots powered by various sources (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, TXT files, free text, YouTube videos, MP3s, scheduled web links, FAQs, etc.). It should integrate with Twilio, where each user must enter their own API key to connect the two platforms, enabling them to interact with the chatbot via phone calls (speech-to-speech). Additionally, it should support integration with Zapier and Cal.com for other functionalities.

The chatbot should utilise the Together.ai APIs (I initially considered the Llama 3.2 11B model, which is more cost-effective than ChatGPT, though I would like your opinion on this choice) and the ElevenLabs voice interface (on which I would also appreciate your feedback). Furthermore, the chatbot must be compatible with major platforms such as WordPress, Shopify, etc.

Chatbots created by users should always be white-label, allowing for customisation with individual colours and logos.

To effectively manage customer support requests, it would be beneficial to have a system that allows customers to open support tickets, which can be managed from the backend (by the site administrator). I would also like to have usage statistics and monitoring of subscription statuses, sales, API usage, costs associated with API usage, and earnings per user, among other metrics.

The plans offered to customers will be as follows:

* Basic
* Premium
* Custom (agents developed ad hoc, for which I will gradually request a development quote)
The key difference between the first two plans will be the ability to create chatbots with voice integration and knowledge uploading via YouTube and MP3.

As you can see, the plans are straightforward and almost all-inclusive, with only a few easy-to-understand differences.

Currently, I do not have anything designed for the homepage, so a logo will need to be created (something simple, nothing sophisticated). I would prefer the website to have light colours and, of course, incorporate a chatbot to answer customer questions, as it is essential to build trust in your products.

The ideal candidate should be able to deliver a high-quality, scalable solution within 2-4 months.

6) Voice interface with ElevenLabs (or an alternative, subject to review):

 * Implementation of voice synthesis with ElevenLabs.

I need help creating agents and workflows within an AI Workflow Automation Platform called "Mindpal" (https://mindpal.space/).   

Right now I have a very specific need (to create PDF product information documents based on information in my website). 

However, I will soon have other uses for this type of "AI automation," so I'd like to find someone who is knowledgeable and comfortable with this type of application, so we can work together as needed for future projects using Mindpal.

I'll attach a screenshot to give an idea of how this particular app appears. Although I'm open to hiring someone who isn't necessarily familiar with "Mindpal," I do need to ask that only those who are familiar with "AI Workflow Automation" apply.

Looking for a tech' guru that masters AI and ChatGPT in order to (by order of priority):

1 - Replace partially humans that interact with clients on a chat for that purpose, you'll have access to the history of chats in order to determine the most recurrent questions from clients and the most efficient way to reply; questions are mainly about their bookings, the chauffeur information and most of them could be found in the database (MongoDB). There's a need to build the business logic on AI (1 booking = 1 client/1 company, passenger(s), a type of booking, supplier info, chauffeur info, status, payment status, .. etc).
As well, most of the typical replies we give to clients are listed into a tool called "text expander".

2 - We have a set of alerts that goes to our agents, when they need to perform tasks, example: reach out by whatsapp or phone to a driver to ask him to update his status on the driver app; ask a supplier to update/confirm a booking or a change made on a booking, etc.. those tasks could be automated including reaching out by phone (with text to speech) or via Whatsapp API.
3 - Manage the multi-langage side of the chats.

Hey,

I hope you are doing well! We have an AI sales call role play software - essentially letting you practice your pitch with an AI prospect.

We recently started niching it down for real estate agents, so we started farming a ton of real estate call transcriptions and prompting the bot using Vapi.ai.

We need a conversational intelligence engineer who is well acquainted with Vapi to finetune our prompt so that the AI is functioning like a real homeowner getting a call from a real estate agent.

Their responses should reflect a mix of hesitation, objections, and slight interest depending on the specific scenario of the call and then they'll probe to see whether or not they book an appointment with them.

There are also some components in the prompt that call the backend like persona profile, call type, and difficulty setting.

We already have a ton of different prompts that we have tested on Vapi, so we have a lot of material for you to use and work off of.

Here is our current prompt that we are fine-tuning right now: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qS2cCqD1X828YZN476wfSfbQf2kqP02llQFYbXBG2oE/edit?usp=sharing

Objective with Multi-Agent System: I am building a multi-agent system where each AI agent has a specific role in refining, scoring, and enhancing psychological descriptions based on my NewCore model. The purpose of this system is to allow AI agents to collaboratively produce, review, and perfect descriptions for each of my descritpion of the type in NewCore by providing iterative feedback, corrections, and scoring.

Goal: The ultimate goal is to achieve a high-quality, accurate, and nuanced description for each  type that aligns perfectly with NewCore’s framework, ideally scoring a 10/10 in accuracy, depth, and mechanical purity.

How the Multi-Agent System Works:

Primary Generation Agent:

The initial agent, known as the Generation Agent, is responsible for producing the first version of each type description based on the NewCore framework.

This agent uses the principles provided in the NewCore guidelines to generate an output 

Feedback and Scoring Agents:

After the Generation Agent creates the initial description, several Feedback Agents review the output from different perspectives.

Each Feedback Agent has specific criteria to evaluate, such as clarity, adherence to the NewCore framework, and absence of generic language. 

Scoring: Each Feedback Agent assigns a score (e.g., out of 10) for the output’s quality, accuracy, and adherence to guidelines. The goal is for the description to consistently reach a score of 9/10 or higher.

Aggregator Agent:

After feedback and scores are provided, an Aggregator Agent consolidates the feedback, synthesizes improvements, and produces a consolidated list of refinements.

This agent’s role is to organize feedback efficiently so that the Generation Agent can integrate all adjustments in the next iteration.

Iteration and Refinement Loop:

The Generation Agent, based on the Aggregator Agent’s consolidated feedback, revises the description and creates a new version.

This new version undergoes the same process with the Feedback and Scoring Agents, who reassess and provide updated scores and comments.

This iterative loop continues until the description consistently reaches a high-quality threshold (10/10), or until further changes no longer yield significant improvements.

Stopping Conditions:

To avoid endless loops, the system includes stopping conditions:
Quality Threshold: When an output reaches a score of 10/10 (or meets specific quality criteria), the iteration stops.

Diminishing Returns: If consecutive feedback results in minimal change or improvement, the Aggregator Agent can decide to terminate the process for that section.

Manual Intervention:

There are checkpoints where I, as the overseer, can review the process and provide manual input if necessary.

This allows me to step in if any agent consistently misinterprets feedback or fails to meet NewCore’s requirements, helping to fine-tune the agents' performance.

Expected Outcome: With this multi-agent system, each section of the Newcore type descriptions can be generated and perfected through iterative collaboration, resulting in a polished, accurate, and consistent output for all nine types. This structure also supports the scalability of the process, allowing it to be applied efficiently to more complex tasks like double types and combinng three types in the future.

Seeking an experienced developer to enhance our existing PHP-based AI chatbot tailored for legal professionals. The primary objective is to integrate the CourtListener API to enable the chatbot to retrieve, analyze, and intelligently respond to user queries using relevant case law and statutes. Unlike a traditional search engine that merely lists summaries, our goal is for the chatbot to understand the content of the case law and provide insightful, context-aware responses based on the user's query and prompts.

NOTE: Integration has already begun. The chatbot currently has access to the CourtListener API and can retrieve data. However, the parsing of the retrieved data and the generation of natural, intelligent responses based on that data are not yet completed. The chatbot can draw data from the API but isn't fully integrating the API responses into user interactions.

Key Responsibilities:

1. API Integration:

Seamlessly integrate the CourtListener API into our existing PHP application.

Ensure secure and efficient data retrieval from the API.



2. Full-Text Analysis:

Enable the chatbot to access and analyze the full text of relevant case law, not just summaries.

Implement parsing and processing of legal documents to extract pertinent information.



3. Intelligent Response Generation:

Develop algorithms or utilize existing NLP techniques to allow the chatbot to synthesize information from case law.

Ensure responses are contextually relevant and legally sound.



4. Contextual Understanding:

Enhance the chatbot's ability to understand user prompts and extract search parameters (e.g., keywords, jurisdictions, dates).

Maintain conversation context to allow for follow-up questions and iterative queries.



5. Testing and Validation:

Rigorously test the integration to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Validate that the chatbot's responses meet legal standards and are helpful to professionals.





---

Required Skills and Experience:

API Integration Expertise:

Proven experience integrating RESTful APIs into PHP applications.

Familiarity with the CourtListener API or similar legal data sources is a plus.


Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Experience with NLP libraries and frameworks (e.g., NLTK, spaCy).

Ability to process and analyze legal language and terminology.


AI and Chatbot Development:

Background in developing AI-driven chatbots or conversational agents.

Understanding of context management in conversations.


PHP Proficiency:

Strong command of PHP and related frameworks.

I need to attend Zoom or Teams calls, but have a set-up where I don't have to listen or speak natively through speaker and mic so I can attend multiple calls and interact when needed.

Ideal: I'm looking for a set-up where I can have audio out and in coming from one computer into a second computer (or specialized device) where speech-to-text is displayed in real-time from what is being said in the meeting. Then when someone starts talking to me I can answer with text-to-speech with a clone of my own voice. Usually, I'd only need to say a few words like, "Yes" or "I don't have any questions", etc. This would allow me to start the zoom on computer one, monitor the text output on computer 2, and type any answers/interactions.

I'm willing to pay for subscription services, I've seen multiple things out there that seem like they could do it like Eleven Labs but I need help setting it up.

Fall-back: If I could at least get the speech-to-text half (audio out) transcribed in real-time. that would be helpful. I'm open to hearing solutions that can

Key feature, this has to work over audio in/out connection to the first computer that is hosting the zoom or teams call with no software installed on that first computer.

Hello!

I am interested in a mentorship opportunity in the direction of AI Chatbot. Currently, I am working with the following stack: LangGraph, Next.js, Node.js, and pgvector (PostgreSQL).

I’m interested in how to handle:
1. State Management: How can I save information from the database into a state and extract only the necessary data? For example, I need to fetch data such as the product name, description, and price. However, the price should not be displayed in the chat unless the user explicitly asks for it.
2. Memory Optimization: How can I implement a memory system to avoid fetching the same data multiple times from the database?
3. Response Optimization: When fetching data from the database, the description field can contain up to 10000 characters. How can I optimize this to generate a response limited to three sentences for the user?
4. Multiple Agents: How can I create multiple specialized agents to handle:
    * Product information
    * Delivery status

I need someone to set up a process which deploys Langgraph Applications (1) that allows me to input a langgraph application and have it be deployed with custom environment variables to our own aws infrastructure, then release an endpoint to contact it and use it with the 'RemoteGraph' class (2) and Langgraph-sdk (3) in the same way that a normal langgraph deployment would work.

I need this deployment to be isolated to the single endpoint and have auto-scaling ability. 

I need to be able to take in a github repo of a user's langgraph application and deploy it to our infrastructure, then release an endpoint to use that graph on our own infrastructure.  We can use the langgraph cli to take in a user's repo and deploy the graph easily, we just need to set up our own infrastructure to handle this instead of doing it locally.

This is well-documented for running the graph locally, but not exactly in our exact use-case. We will need to piece together different principles from the docs/examples to accomplish this. I am well-versed in langgraph and deploying it traditionally to langgraph cloud and running it locally, but don't have the time to complete this entire task and set up the infrastructure. i will work along side with you and answer as many questions as I can.

I need to attend Zoom or Teams calls, but have a set-up where I don't have to listen or speak natively through speaker and mic so I can attend multiple calls and interact when needed.

Ideal: I'm looking for a set-up where I can have audio out and in coming from one computer into a second computer (or specialized device) where speech-to-text is displayed in real-time from what is being said in the meeting. Then when someone starts talking to me I can answer with text-to-speech with a clone of my own voice. Usually, I'd only need to say a few words like, "Yes" or "I don't have any questions", etc. This would allow me to start the zoom on computer one, monitor the text output on computer 2, and type any answers/interactions.

I'm willing to pay for subscription services, I've seen multiple things out there that seem like they could do it like Eleven Labs but I need help setting it up.

Fall-back: If I could at least get the speech-to-text half (audio out) transcribed in real-time. that would be helpful. I'm open to hearing solutions that can

Key feature, this has to work over audio in/out connection to the first computer that is hosting the zoom or teams call with no software installed on that first computer.

I have a breast pump which has an integrated pressure sensor. I want to detect an improper assembly of the breast pump in use by finding criteria in the pressure sensor data that helps me distinguish between an air leak and no air leak. 

To do this I collected data on several pumps in different configurations: no leak, small leak, large leak, full leak. 

Each pump is tested is all use of its possible settings which are a combination of:
- 2 modes (stimulation to stimulate milk ejection reflex and expression to express the milk), 
- 8 levels in each mode to adjust the suction power
- 3 suction speeds to adjust cycle speed

In total there are 2 * 8 * 3 = 48 cycle types. The algorithm should distinguish leaks from non leaks in as many cycle types as possible. 
The leak levels can also be found in the data so that we can evaluate algorithms also on the size of leak detected (maybe only large leaks can be detected by a certain algorithm for example)

In the data all the settings are available. I have already identified options for distinguishing criteria in some cases but this would need to be done better with more criteria and create the most robust algorithm for this problem. 

Once the algorithm is validated please create a ticket for our app developers to integrate your algorithm into our app in Typescript. 
A first version of the algorithm should be ready next week and a second version in January.

I am looking for help with a computer vision project. It is mostly available on a GitHub page, but I need some modifications and additions to meet my needs.  

The application is based on "Multiply" from GitHub. It currently works with sequences involving 2+ actors, but I need it to work with sequences involving a single actor as well as multiple actors.  

I would prefer the application to work with JPG sequences only. FFmpeg integration is not needed.  

The preprocessing stage must include the ability to export camera and SMPL-X data to FBX format and also to import camera and SMPL-X data from FBX. This is a must-have, as opposed to being limited to forced trace input → training.  

We can use the example data available on GitHub to start, and I can also provide data for single-actor sequences.  

For preprocessing, I want to integrate ViTPose and OpenPose to improve accuracy.  

FBX import and export should be the preferred method for handling camera and SMPL-X data. I will handle the custom SMPL-X Maya rig and cameras on my side. If the trace camera and SMPL-X data can be exported to me as FBX (from the preprocessing stage), I will set up my system to parse the data into the trainer.  

The goal is to ensure compatibility with my workflow, allowing seamless export/import of camera and SMPL-X data via FBX while enhancing the accuracy of preprocessing with ViTPose and OpenPose.

Please only reply if you have any experience with similar projects. No Chat-gpt responses please.

I am working on a new woocommerce wordpress build for a client that sells many thousands of products. He is expecting to upload 10,000 products per week. We have built an existing website for him, but the current bulk import process limits him to a few thousand a week due to some manual steps slowing him down.

In the new website, her wants:
- Google Vision AI integrated for OCR and AI.
- Each product has a front and back image and he wants to use the OCR to extract the text from the images to be used in custom product fields
- He wants to then have AI create keyword rich titles and product descriptions based on the product info.

Other things to know:
- He imports products in csv format 
- We're heavily leaning toward Google Vision AI because it combines AI and OCR, but are open to other suggestions
- I spent a few hours starting a custom plugin to handle everything in one place on the backend. This client needs the process to be very easy for his team.

I'm not 100% how the actual process should work, so I'll need your insight. We need the client to be able to bulk import the images, have them scanned by Google Vision AI to pull text with OCR and then have AI generate the product name and description, while also importing the spreadsheet that has the rest of the product info to match.

I am quoting this out to the client, please let me know your quote.

Here are the key requirements for the solution:

Speech-to-Text:
We need to accurately transcribe audio from doctor-patient interactions in real time. The transcription should handle various accents and medical terminologies seamlessly. Azure’s Speech-to-Text API seems ideal for this, especially for its accuracy and adaptability.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Once the audio is transcribed, the text needs to be analyzed with NLP to extract clinical data, such as symptoms, medical history, diagnosis, and treatment plans. This extracted data will be structured into a SOAP note template:

Subjective (S): Patient’s description of symptoms and concerns.
Objective (O): Healthcare provider’s observations and examination results.
Assessment (A): Diagnosis based on the subjective and objective data.
Plan (P): Treatment plan, follow-ups, and referrals.
Leveraging Azure AI Models:
It would be helpful to integrate Azure’s NLP models to extract medical-specific information, such as symptoms, conditions, and medical terminology. Azure’s Text Analytics for Health would be useful for processing medical text and enhancing context-specific analysis. In addition, we may want to incorporate entity recognition and sentiment analysis to refine the extracted data.

Integration with EHR Systems:
The transcriptions and generated SOAP notes should be easily integrated into existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems or other healthcare management software the team uses. This will streamline the workflow for healthcare providers, ensuring they can focus on patient care while maintaining accurate records.

Could you help with integrating these functionalities and provide guidance on how to leverage Azure’s services for this? I’d appreciate any advice on structuring the NLP component to effectively extract relevant information and format it into a SOAP note. Additionally, any suggestions on fine-tuning models for the medical domain would be valuable.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and any recommendations you may have!

I am looking for help with a computer vision project. It is mostly available on a GitHub page, but I need some modifications and additions to meet my needs.  

The application is based on "Multiply" from GitHub. It currently works with sequences involving 2+ actors, but I need it to work with sequences involving a single actor as well as multiple actors.  

I would prefer the application to work with JPG sequences only. FFmpeg integration is not needed.  

The preprocessing stage must include the ability to export camera and SMPL-X data to FBX format and also to import camera and SMPL-X data from FBX. This is a must-have, as opposed to being limited to forced trace input → training.  

We can use the example data available on GitHub to start, and I can also provide data for single-actor sequences.  

For preprocessing, I want to integrate ViTPose and OpenPose to improve accuracy.  

FBX import and export should be the preferred method for handling camera and SMPL-X data. I will handle the custom SMPL-X Maya rig and cameras on my side. If the trace camera and SMPL-X data can be exported to me as FBX (from the preprocessing stage), I will set up my system to parse the data into the trainer.  

The goal is to ensure compatibility with my workflow, allowing seamless export/import of camera and SMPL-X data via FBX while enhancing the accuracy of preprocessing with ViTPose and OpenPose.

Dear,

I am looking for a developer to help me create a program that integrates several pre-existing AI models and deep learning techniques to achieve seamless functionality. The goal of this program is to edit photos, specifically by detecting, removing, and adding objects (such as furniture) within an image. All the AI models required for this project are already available on GitHub, so nothing needs to be programmed from scratch. The primary task is to ensure these models work together effectively to achieve the desired functionality.

Features:
Photo Upload: Users should be able to upload an image to the program.
Object Detection: Objects (such as furniture) in the uploaded image need to be detected with contours (not bounding boxes). For this, I suggest using Detectron2 or a better alternative if you have one.
Object Selection: Users should be able to click on objects to select them. Selected objects should be visually marked, for example, with a colored contour or highlight.
Object Removal: Users should be able to remove selected objects from the image with a button. For background inpainting, I propose using LaMa or DeepFillv2.
Object Insertion: Users should be able to add new objects to the image. These objects must be displayed realistically, in the correct scale and dimensions. I suggest using ARKit or ARCore for this functionality.
Important Notes:
All AI models required (e.g., Detectron2, LaMa, DeepFillv2, ARKit/ARCore) can be downloaded from GitHub and used directly.
The main goal is to ensure these models are integrated and work seamlessly together within a single program.
If you have better suggestions for alternative models or techniques, I am open to your recommendations.
The user interface does not need to be perfect at this stage but should be intuitive enough to perform the outlined functions.
There is no strict deadline for this project.
Visual Examples:
To give you a better idea of what I’m envisioning, I will include three example images showing how the program’s functionality should look. These will be sent along with this message.

Questions:
Is this something you can develop? If so, could you provide an estimate of the time and cost required? Additionally, if you have any suggestions or foresee potential challenges, I would appreciate your insights.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,
Caglar Yuksel

We are looking for 4 simple conversational LM's to be made for training. These conversational models should be all connected to the same data base. 

Model 1 - This model will be fed hours of video calls and a training rubric alongside a few basic prompts and this model will be a live training mode to teach new hires how to better understand our software. This will be our round 1 training of taking 5 days work of training material and feeding it so that a user can simply go to it and train. 

Model 2 - This model will then do a live quiz on each trainee and determine based on what they should know give them a score. There will be a rubric given on how the live conversational quizzes should be. 

Model 3 - This model will take into consideration what he previous user scored and where their weaknesses are and do a mock discovery call based on this and challenge them on their weaknesses. The model will make mock scenarios on why they would want the product, we will give a rubric on what the discovery call should be like. 

Model 4 - This model will then do a mock demo to the trainee and based on the score and the issues they face in the discovery to make them demo the product even better. 

Front End UI/UX Experience: We will require users to create a simple email and user name login along with first and last name, nothing fancy is needed and this is how the model will determine which party is which. We will need a simple backend system for admin to see each users score and status on where they are. 

We will give all data needed for each model, this will be a conversational model each for the trainee to chat with. We also will need a toggle of "Difficulty Level" : Easy, Moderate, Hard, Extremely Challenging. 

We would be using Chat GPT for the model, Mongo DB for the data base, a simple front end website, and AWS in which we all have already set up. This should be a quick and easy buildout as we have all the data needed to train the model. 

We have several other models left that need to be completed. This needs to be a model they can chat back and forth with audio only.

3. "How many sales order lines did we create in 2024?"
4. "What is the total booking amount for 2024?"
5. "What is the total booking amount per business unit in 2024?"

Challenges:
1. The data lacks textual richness and cannot be modified or enriched.
2. The environment is constrained to Azure AI Studio (Playground), limiting advanced model customizations.
3. Direct access to the database cannot be provided due to security constraints.

The AI will produce drawings in AutoCAD, adhering to client-specific standards while enabling easy customization for exceptions.

Key Features:

Dynamic Client Management:
Each client has a dedicated folder structure.
Client-specific standards (e.g., CAD blocks, hardware specifications, templates) are stored for reuse.
Generic resources are available for clients without predefined standards.

AI-Powered Drawing Automation:
Extract dimensions, layouts, and other key data from client-provided PDFs/DWG files.
Generate shop drawings in AutoCAD using client-specific standards or generic defaults.
Support for section views, elevations, and custom details.
Exception Handling:
Clients can specify exceptions (e.g., custom hinges, unique materials).
Exception data is stored per project in the project exceptions folder.
Prompts to add new exceptions to the client's standard resources for future reuse.

Input and Output Management:
Input: Project-specific files such as architectural drawings and hardware specs.
Output: Project-specific shop drawings, stored in the client’s project folder.

Human-Like Interaction (eventually):
Act as a virtual customer service agent to guide clients through providing project details.
Collect and refine client-specific standards over time through natural interaction.

Multi-User Support:
The system is scalable for multiple clients and users, with cloud/server-based deployment planned for uptime and reliability.

Monetization:
System usage is designed to generate revenue based on a per-project or subscription model.

Technical Overview:
File Structure:

Root directory contains:
clients/: Contains individual client folders with their standards and project data.
resources/: Stores generic standards (e.g., CAD templates, blocks, hardware specs) for clients without predefined resources.

logs/: For tracking activity and debugging.

Technology Stack:
Languages/Frameworks: Python, .NET (for AutoCAD API integration)
Tools:

AutoCAD (full version) with .NET API for drawing automation.
Tesseract OCR and PDF libraries for parsing architectural drawings.
SQL Server for data storage and client standard management

This will most likely be hosted in house.  Access will be provided as needed.  It would be nice if some (most) development can be done local to the developer and then switched to our server as needed.

I am searching for someone to help me with the following project. I hope you can help me.

I need an APP optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations written in hardware description languages VHDL or Verilog for the AMD Alveo™ U50 Data Center Accelerator Card or similar other FDPA. The app should be as basic as possible, but it needs to outperform the top-performance CPUs such as Ryzen 9 7950x or IntelCore i9 14900K.

AMD Alveo™ U50 Data Center Accelerator Card
(link removed)

The app will be used for mining (PoW) activities for the Matrix AI Network project: (link removed)

From the MATRIX 1.0 White Paper, the recommended hardware for mining activities should focus on devices optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. These computations are integral to the MATRIX blockchain's Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism and differ from traditional hash-based mining.
White paper link: (link removed)

I am a community member heavily involved in mining activities in the last years with multiple CPUs. Still, I am hitting the limitations with CPUs and need a performance boost with FPGAs. There is no available ASIC for MCMC computations. GPU mining is not allowed.

How long should it take to develop such an APP?
What are the basic asses cost to develop such an APP?  I need to think carefully about the development cost over the suggested price.

	•	Team transparency information (e.g., public team members, known backers).
	•	Current market capitalization (focus on projects with relatively low or moderate market caps).
	•	Use an API if available; otherwise, consider web scraping.
	2.	Criteria-Based Analysis with AI:
	•	Implement an AI-driven module (e.g., NLP and ML-based) to assess projects based on criteria such as:
	•	Currently generating revenue and profit (or losses).
	•	Has some operational history or early traction.
	•	Attracted noteworthy investors/funding rounds.
	•	Transparent and credible team.
	•	Relatively low market capitalization (still “under the radar”).
	•	The AI should flag projects that meet these criteria.
	•	Include a qualitative assessment of the project’s described utility, while leaving the final judgment to me.
	3.	Output & Dashboard:
	•	Store results in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Google Sheets, or a database).
	•	Ideally, provide a simple dashboard or visualization interface to browse, sort, and filter projects by criteria, AI-driven suitability scores, and market cap.
	4.	Technical Requirements & Deliverables:
	•	A fully turnkey solution: The developer should handle all setup, including server deployment, so I can start using the platform immediately.
	•	Well-structured, documented codebase.
	•	Clear instructions on how to maintain the scraper and AI analysis modules.
	•	If a dashboard is included, provide instructions for future updates or adjustments.
	5.	Additional Notes:
	•	No investment advice is required—this is purely data-driven filtering and scoring.
	•	The AI component may combine heuristics, NLP, and ML techniques.
	•	The focus is on identifying promising, revenue-generating projects with low market cap and transparent teams.
	•	The product description’s utility should be partially evaluated by AI, but I will make the final judgment.

Ideal Candidate:
	•	Strong experience with web scraping, APIs, and data ETL processes.
	•	Familiarity with AI/NLP frameworks (e.g., Python-based solutions, Hugging Face, OpenAI API).
	•	Understanding of crypto/DeFi analytics is a plus.
	•	Ability to deliver a ready-to-use, hosted solution.
	•	Good communication skills and the ability to deliver a maintainable solution.

Hi all,

I am London-based working in the health sector, looking to develop a proof-of-concept. In the event the PoC is successful, there would be more working coming your way so preferably I am looking for somebody London or UK based.

I am open-minded to level of experience including entry-level, students or grads because I am price-sensitive!

The aim of this project is to develop a proof of concept generative AI voice call chatbot for a specific service that I have in mind. The chatbot receives calls, it doesn't make outbound calls. It has four key questions that it asks the caller. 

Questions 1 and 2 are very simple, requiring simply "yes", "no" or "don't know"/caller doesn't know answers. Question 3 is also quite simple, but the caller may answer in a range of ways. The chatbot simply needs to convert answers 1-2 into yes/no/don't know and 3 into text. The fourth question is "What is your location?". Question 4 will require the chatbot to lookup a location on Google Maps or another map software to identify the caller's location, preferably narrowed down by their caller line identity location.

For this proof of concept, the output of the call is for all the information captured to be sent in a text message back to the caller. The next stages of the project would be to integrate this into a call handling system, this is not neccessary for the proof of concept. 

Please note it is a requirement of this project to have a working phone number and proof of concept speech-to-text and text-to-speech chatbot sending a text message as output at the end of the call. I can provide the hosting, Twilio account and phone number etc.

Thanks - I really appreciate your time and consideration.

If you're passionate about AI and eager to contribute to exciting projects, we'd love to hear from you!

We are seeking an expert in natural language processing (NLP) regression and AI, to create an accurate model with low error rate on test data, the data involves an excel with text to price construction data, I will give you an example : 
"m². Demolition of ceramic or concrete tile roof, by manual means, according to NTE/ADD-3 : 100€". 

-First you must know what I have tried, I tried different methods as vectorization (tfidf, bert, etc) of the text data, tree regressors, fine tuning hugging face models, etc. So where's the problem ? The model is of course very good with train data and has very low error, with 0.8 r2 score, but with test data r2 is negative, so it is not accurate when generalizing with new text data.

-Your objective is, to develop a model that is able to generalize well when predicting test/validation data prices of textual data that is not exact but similar relating to the train data, as you have seen in the example, in test data, the text can vary, and it is not exact, because people can add subtle variations, so the objective, Is more focused on nlp techniques to understand similitudes on the train/test data, etc, and testing this with a model to see if you get good results. I can also give you the models I used to test.

-The data is in spanish, I have an excel with thousands of rows, but I will provide you with just an example of this excel, I will give you the train excel and the test excel.
I will also give you the code to read this excel as a starting point.

-So now I will specify the conditions for the payout, I will pay you with no hesitation only if you archive the desired result, the approximate desired result is : 
             -high r2 score, bigger than 0.7
             -at least, 90% of mae errors, must be within 30% deviation, what that means is that 90% of the time, if the y_test price is 100€, 90% of the predictions must fall in the range of less than 130€ or more than 70€, maybe it is a little hard to understand, but to resume, price error must be very low, but there is a margin of 30% of error allowed.

-The metrics are not 100% exact, If you get very good results, I will evaluate this and if you did a very good job, you will get aproved, If you do a fantastic job, I will pay an extra bonus.

-One more thing, the data I will give you, is only a part of all the data, I have maybe 20000 rows, but I will give you 1000 rows, so once you get good results, I will test your model with all my data, and check if your model or code gets the desired results specified before, if not, we can iterate more to get better results, but unless the model is not good with all the data, the payout cannot be made, only a part of the payout could be made in case you make a very good job.

-Only apply, if you think you have the required persistence and skills to do it, as I have tried a lot of things and I know it is hard, but I must say I'm not and nlp expert, so you probably can do better.

Best regards

Description:
I’m looking for a creative, experienced AI specialist to help me build and understand a multi-agent AI ecosystem for my startup. Initially, I want to start small by creating multiple chat-based “agents” (likely using ChatGPT) for different aspects of my business. Over time, I’d like to expand this setup to include more advanced integrations, such as LangChain, and ultimately develop a highly automated, AI-driven workflow.

What I’m Looking For:
	•	Technical Proficiency: You should be comfortable with ChatGPT, AI agent orchestration tools, and be knowledgeable about LangChain or similar frameworks. Experience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or vector databases is a plus, but not required right away.
	•	Teaching Skills: I’m looking for someone who can guide me through the process. I’m proficient with ChatGPT and technology in general, but I’m not deeply technical. You should be patient, communicative, and able to explain complex concepts simply.
	•	A Passion for Thinking Differently: I value innovative problem-solvers who can help me approach workflows and automations in new ways. I’m not looking for a cookie-cutter solution—I want to explore and learn what’s possible.
	•	Portfolio or Demonstration Video: Preference will be given to candidates who can provide a short video demonstrating a past project they’ve built—showcasing how you integrated multiple AI agents, used LangChain, or automated tasks with AI. This can be a screen recording with a voiceover explanation.

Responsibilities:
	1.	Initial Setup: Help design and configure multiple AI “agents” (e.g., separate chats or integrated solutions) for different facets of the business (operations, marketing, development support, etc.).
	2.	Integration Roadmap: Develop a phased plan to move from simple chat-based agents to a more complex workflow that might include LangChain and other advanced tool integrations.
	3.	Tutoring & Guidance: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and live tutoring sessions (via Zoom or similar platform) to teach me how to manage, update, and maintain these workflows independently.
	4.	Ongoing Support: Offer guidance on best practices, potential tools, and upgrades as needed.

To Apply:
	•	Please briefly describe your experience with AI agents, ChatGPT, and any relevant frameworks (like LangChain).
	•	Mention your experience in teaching or tutoring non-technical individuals.
	•	Include a link to a short video demonstration if possible. This can be a new recording or something you’ve prepared previously.

This is an exciting opportunity for someone who loves to think outside the box, build intuitive AI workflows, and empower a founder to become more self-sufficient in managing them. I look forward to collaborating with you!

I’m interested in how to handle:
1. State Management: How can I save information from the database into a state and extract only the necessary data? For example, I need to fetch data such as the product name, description, and price. However, the price should not be displayed in the chat unless the user explicitly asks for it.
2. Memory Optimization: How can I implement a memory system to avoid fetching the same data multiple times from the database?
3. Response Optimization: When fetching data from the database, the description field can contain up to 10000 characters. How can I optimize this to generate a response limited to three sentences for the user?
4. Multiple Agents: How can I create multiple specialized agents to handle:
    * Product information
    * Delivery status
    * Issue resolution
5. Configuring Output Formats: How can I configure different output formats for the system? For example, supporting plain text, JSON, or rich UI components for user interactions.
6. Integration as a Module: How can I develop the system as a reusable module that can be easily integrated into different web platforms?

Do you work with these technologies and are you considering a mentorship opportunity?

We have a number of CSV files that are well-structured (labelled columns and rows) that we want to put into a Chat-GPT for our small company, but have no experience with "prompt engineering" to take that raw data and create Pivot tables in Excel where we don't have to use the complex field names in the columns to have that conversation with ChatGPT.  So once it's setup with the correct prompts, we can use Chat-GPT conversation to ask it "tell me total sales for 2024" in a pivot table where it's shareable with the other 2 or 3 people in the company.   We have a new Chat-CPT Team setup, but just no experience or time (I own the company) to do this. Looking for a much younger person with some building expertise with Chat GPT 4 and MS Excel (not sure of what model version we should use for Excel and pivot table work), but 4.o seems to be ok, but I don't know what to ask for, if you will. I would like to stay away from Microsoft Copilot for Excel if at all possible...had a negative experience with that a couple of months ago.. chatGPT seems to be easier to deal with.

I am working on a new woocommerce wordpress build for a client that sells many thousands of products. He is expecting to upload 10,000 products per week. We have built an existing website for him, but the current bulk import process limits him to a few thousand a week due to some manual steps slowing him down.

In the new website, her wants:
- Google Vision AI integrated for OCR and AI.
- Each product has a front and back image and he wants to use the OCR to extract the text from the images to be used in custom product fields
- He wants to then have AI create keyword rich titles and product descriptions based on the product info.

Other things to know:
- He imports products in csv format 
- We're heavily leaning toward Google Vision AI because it combines AI and OCR, but are open to other suggestions
- I spent a few hours starting a custom plugin to handle everything in one place on the backend. This client needs the process to be very easy for his team.

I'm not 100% how the actual process should work, so I'll need your insight. We need the client to be able to bulk import the images, have them scanned by Google Vision AI to pull text with OCR and then have AI generate the product name and description, while also importing the spreadsheet that has the rest of the product info to match.

I am quoting this out to the client, please let me know your quote.

Here are the key requirements for the solution:

Speech-to-Text:
We need to accurately transcribe audio from doctor-patient interactions in real time. The transcription should handle various accents and medical terminologies seamlessly. Azure’s Speech-to-Text API seems ideal for this, especially for its accuracy and adaptability.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Once the audio is transcribed, the text needs to be analyzed with NLP to extract clinical data, such as symptoms, medical history, diagnosis, and treatment plans. This extracted data will be structured into a SOAP note template:

Subjective (S): Patient’s description of symptoms and concerns.
Objective (O): Healthcare provider’s observations and examination results.
Assessment (A): Diagnosis based on the subjective and objective data.
Plan (P): Treatment plan, follow-ups, and referrals.
Leveraging Azure AI Models:
It would be helpful to integrate Azure’s NLP models to extract medical-specific information, such as symptoms, conditions, and medical terminology. Azure’s Text Analytics for Health would be useful for processing medical text and enhancing context-specific analysis. In addition, we may want to incorporate entity recognition and sentiment analysis to refine the extracted data.

Integration with EHR Systems:
The transcriptions and generated SOAP notes should be easily integrated into existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems or other healthcare management software the team uses. This will streamline the workflow for healthcare providers, ensuring they can focus on patient care while maintaining accurate records.

Could you help with integrating these functionalities and provide guidance on how to leverage Azure’s services for this? I’d appreciate any advice on structuring the NLP component to effectively extract relevant information and format it into a SOAP note. Additionally, any suggestions on fine-tuning models for the medical domain would be valuable.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and any recommendations you may have!

I am looking for help with a computer vision project. It is mostly available on a GitHub page, but I need some modifications and additions to meet my needs.  

The application is based on "Multiply" from GitHub. It currently works with sequences involving 2+ actors, but I need it to work with sequences involving a single actor as well as multiple actors.  

I would prefer the application to work with JPG sequences only. FFmpeg integration is not needed.  

The preprocessing stage must include the ability to export camera and SMPL-X data to FBX format and also to import camera and SMPL-X data from FBX. This is a must-have, as opposed to being limited to forced trace input → training.  

We can use the example data available on GitHub to start, and I can also provide data for single-actor sequences.  

For preprocessing, I want to integrate ViTPose and OpenPose to improve accuracy.  

FBX import and export should be the preferred method for handling camera and SMPL-X data. I will handle the custom SMPL-X Maya rig and cameras on my side. If the trace camera and SMPL-X data can be exported to me as FBX (from the preprocessing stage), I will set up my system to parse the data into the trainer.  

The goal is to ensure compatibility with my workflow, allowing seamless export/import of camera and SMPL-X data via FBX while enhancing the accuracy of preprocessing with ViTPose and OpenPose.

Dear,

I am looking for a developer to help me create a program that integrates several pre-existing AI models and deep learning techniques to achieve seamless functionality. The goal of this program is to edit photos, specifically by detecting, removing, and adding objects (such as furniture) within an image. All the AI models required for this project are already available on GitHub, so nothing needs to be programmed from scratch. The primary task is to ensure these models work together effectively to achieve the desired functionality.

Features:
Photo Upload: Users should be able to upload an image to the program.
Object Detection: Objects (such as furniture) in the uploaded image need to be detected with contours (not bounding boxes). For this, I suggest using Detectron2 or a better alternative if you have one.
Object Selection: Users should be able to click on objects to select them. Selected objects should be visually marked, for example, with a colored contour or highlight.
Object Removal: Users should be able to remove selected objects from the image with a button. For background inpainting, I propose using LaMa or DeepFillv2.
Object Insertion: Users should be able to add new objects to the image. These objects must be displayed realistically, in the correct scale and dimensions. I suggest using ARKit or ARCore for this functionality.
Important Notes:
All AI models required (e.g., Detectron2, LaMa, DeepFillv2, ARKit/ARCore) can be downloaded from GitHub and used directly.
The main goal is to ensure these models are integrated and work seamlessly together within a single program.
If you have better suggestions for alternative models or techniques, I am open to your recommendations.
The user interface does not need to be perfect at this stage but should be intuitive enough to perform the outlined functions.
There is no strict deadline for this project.
Visual Examples:
To give you a better idea of what I’m envisioning, I will include three example images showing how the program’s functionality should look. These will be sent along with this message.

Questions:
Is this something you can develop? If so, could you provide an estimate of the time and cost required? Additionally, if you have any suggestions or foresee potential challenges, I would appreciate your insights.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Kind regards,
Caglar Yuksel

We are looking for 4 simple conversational LM's to be made for training. These conversational models should be all connected to the same data base. 

Model 1 - This model will be fed hours of video calls and a training rubric alongside a few basic prompts and this model will be a live training mode to teach new hires how to better understand our software. This will be our round 1 training of taking 5 days work of training material and feeding it so that a user can simply go to it and train. 

Model 2 - This model will then do a live quiz on each trainee and determine based on what they should know give them a score. There will be a rubric given on how the live conversational quizzes should be. 

Model 3 - This model will take into consideration what he previous user scored and where their weaknesses are and do a mock discovery call based on this and challenge them on their weaknesses. The model will make mock scenarios on why they would want the product, we will give a rubric on what the discovery call should be like. 

Model 4 - This model will then do a mock demo to the trainee and based on the score and the issues they face in the discovery to make them demo the product even better. 

Front End UI/UX Experience: We will require users to create a simple email and user name login along with first and last name, nothing fancy is needed and this is how the model will determine which party is which. We will need a simple backend system for admin to see each users score and status on where they are. 

We will give all data needed for each model, this will be a conversational model each for the trainee to chat with. We also will need a toggle of "Difficulty Level" : Easy, Moderate, Hard, Extremely Challenging. 

We would be using Chat GPT for the model, Mongo DB for the data base, a simple front end website, and AWS in which we all have already set up. This should be a quick and easy buildout as we have all the data needed to train the model. 

We have several other models left that need to be completed. This needs to be a model they can chat back and forth with audio only.

I am searching for someone to help me with the following project. I hope you can help me.

I need an APP optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations written in hardware description languages VHDL or Verilog for the AMD Alveo™ U50 Data Center Accelerator Card or similar other FDPA. The app should be as basic as possible, but it needs to outperform the top-performance CPUs such as Ryzen 9 7950x or IntelCore i9 14900K.

AMD Alveo™ U50 Data Center Accelerator Card
(link removed)

The app will be used for mining (PoW) activities for the Matrix AI Network project: (link removed)

From the MATRIX 1.0 White Paper, the recommended hardware for mining activities should focus on devices optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. These computations are integral to the MATRIX blockchain's Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism and differ from traditional hash-based mining.
White paper link: (link removed)

I am a community member heavily involved in mining activities in the last years with multiple CPUs. Still, I am hitting the limitations with CPUs and need a performance boost with FPGAs. There is no available ASIC for MCMC computations. GPU mining is not allowed.

How long should it take to develop such an APP?
What are the basic asses cost to develop such an APP?  I need to think carefully about the development cost over the suggested price.

I am seeking an experienced developer or team to help build an online hair diagnostic tool using Typeform, Zapier, and OpenAI. The tool will allow users to provide detailed information about their hair, upload inspirational photos and photos of their current hair, and receive a personalized analysis with recommendations and pricing.

This is the start of a larger project, and I am looking for someone to help establish the foundation and refine the process for a seamless user experience.

Project Goals:
The tool should enable users to:

Provide key information about their:
Current hair condition.
Desired haircut or style.
Upload:
Photos of hairstyles they like (inspiration photos).
Photos of their current hair for analysis.
Receive:
AI-powered analysis of their hair condition.
Recommendations for hair care and styling.
A personalized consultation with detailed pricing.
Current Status:
I’ve already set up the basics:

Typeform is used for collecting user inputs and photos.
Zapier is integrated to automate parts of the workflow.
OpenAI is connected and generating text-based recommendations.
However, there are critical blockers that need solving to complete the tool:

Current Blockers:
Image Recognition:

Users upload photos of their current hair and inspiration styles via Typeform.
These images need to be securely accessed (via Typeform’s token system) and analyzed.
Tools like ChatGPT Vision, Google Vision AI, or AWS Rekognition may be required to process and interpret the images, extracting key details like hair length, texture, and condition.
Multi-Step Workflow:

The diagnostic requires combining textual inputs from users with insights from photo analysis.
The workflow should ensure that:
Each step (e.g., hair analysis, recommendations, cost estimation) is accurate and aligned.
The final output provides clear, actionable, and tailored advice.
User-Friendly Output:

The results must be rendered as:
A professionally designed email summarizing the analysis, recommendations, and pricing.
Or, displayed dynamically on a WordPress landing page for an interactive user experience.
The design should be visually appealing, easy to understand, and aligned with the brand’s aesthetic.
What I Need Help With:
I am looking for someone who can:

Implement AI-powered photo recognition to analyze the uploaded images and integrate the results into the workflow.
Refine and optimize the workflow automation, ensuring smooth integration between Typeform, Zapier, and OpenAI.
Design and implement a well-structured output, either as a polished email template or a WordPress landing page.
Ensure the entire process is secure, reliable, and scalable.
Future Scope:
This is the beginning of a larger project that may include:

Advanced AI capabilities for more in-depth photo and data analysis.
Development of a standalone platform for diagnostics and consultations.
Integration with booking systems and other tools for a complete customer experience.
Requirements:
Strong experience with Typeform, Zapier, and OpenAI API.
Expertise in AI-powered photo recognition tools like Google Vision AI, AWS Rekognition, or custom models.
Familiarity with designing workflows that integrate text and image analysis.
Ability to create visually appealing email templates and WordPress landing pages.
Understanding of security and privacy protocols for handling sensitive data.
Deliverables:
Fully functional hair diagnostic tool that integrates:
User inputs from Typeform.
Photo recognition for uploaded images.
AI-powered recommendations and pricing.
Seamless workflow automation with accurate multi-step processing.
A beautifully designed output, delivered as an email or displayed on a WordPress page.
Clear documentation of the process and recommendations for scalability.
Why Work on This Project?
This tool is part of an exciting larger initiative to revolutionize personalized hair care consultations. Your work will lay the foundation for a project that could expand significantly in the future.

If you have experience in building AI-powered tools, integrating APIs, and creating smooth user workflows, please apply! Include examples of similar projects you’ve worked on and how you’d approach the current blockers.

Looking forward to collaborating!

I am looking for an experienced developer (or a small team) who can build a turnkey data collection and analysis system for crypto projects using data sourced from TokenTerminal or similar platforms. The goal is to automatically gather information on various emerging projects—especially those that have not yet seen a massive increase in market capitalization—and then use AI-based analysis to identify which projects meet my specified criteria. The final solution should be fully set up on a server, allowing me to use it immediately without additional setup.

Key Requirements:
	1.	Data Collection (Scraper/ETL):
	•	Collect key metrics from TokenTerminal or a similar reliable data source.
	•	The data should include (but not be limited to):
	•	Project name, website, and associated tokens.
	•	Revenue generation data (identify projects currently earning revenue).
	•	Historical performance data, if available.
	•	Funding rounds, raised amounts, and key investors.
	•	Team transparency information (e.g., public team members, known backers).
	•	Current market capitalization (focus on projects with relatively low or moderate market caps).
	•	Use an API if available; otherwise, consider web scraping.
	2.	Criteria-Based Analysis with AI:
	•	Implement an AI-driven module (e.g., NLP and ML-based) to assess projects based on criteria such as:
	•	Currently generating revenue and profit (or losses).
	•	Has some operational history or early traction.
	•	Attracted noteworthy investors/funding rounds.
	•	Transparent and credible team.
	•	Relatively low market capitalization (still “under the radar”).
	•	The AI should flag projects that meet these criteria.
	•	Include a qualitative assessment of the project’s described utility, while leaving the final judgment to me.
	3.	Output & Dashboard:
	•	Store results in a structured format (e.g., CSV, Google Sheets, or a database).
	•	Ideally, provide a simple dashboard or visualization interface to browse, sort, and filter projects by criteria, AI-driven suitability scores, and market cap.
	4.	Technical Requirements & Deliverables:
	•	A fully turnkey solution: The developer should handle all setup, including server deployment, so I can start using the platform immediately.
	•	Well-structured, documented codebase.
	•	Clear instructions on how to maintain the scraper and AI analysis modules.
	•	If a dashboard is included, provide instructions for future updates or adjustments.
	5.	Additional Notes:
	•	No investment advice is required—this is purely data-driven filtering and scoring.
	•	The AI component may combine heuristics, NLP, and ML techniques.
	•	The focus is on identifying promising, revenue-generating projects with low market cap and transparent teams.
	•	The product description’s utility should be partially evaluated by AI, but I will make the final judgment.

Ideal Candidate:
	•	Strong experience with web scraping, APIs, and data ETL processes.
	•	Familiarity with AI/NLP frameworks (e.g., Python-based solutions, Hugging Face, OpenAI API).
	•	Understanding of crypto/DeFi analytics is a plus.
	•	Ability to deliver a ready-to-use, hosted solution.
	•	Good communication skills and the ability to deliver a maintainable solution.

Please include examples of similar projects you have worked on and a rough timeline/estimate of how long this project might take.

Hi all,

I am London-based working in the health sector, looking to develop a proof-of-concept. In the event the PoC is successful, there would be more working coming your way so preferably I am looking for somebody London or UK based.

I am open-minded to level of experience including entry-level, students or grads because I am price-sensitive!

The aim of this project is to develop a proof of concept generative AI voice call chatbot for a specific service that I have in mind. The chatbot receives calls, it doesn't make outbound calls. It has four key questions that it asks the caller. 

Questions 1 and 2 are very simple, requiring simply "yes", "no" or "don't know"/caller doesn't know answers. Question 3 is also quite simple, but the caller may answer in a range of ways. The chatbot simply needs to convert answers 1-2 into yes/no/don't know and 3 into text. The fourth question is "What is your location?". Question 4 will require the chatbot to lookup a location on Google Maps or another map software to identify the caller's location, preferably narrowed down by their caller line identity location.

For this proof of concept, the output of the call is for all the information captured to be sent in a text message back to the caller. The next stages of the project would be to integrate this into a call handling system, this is not neccessary for the proof of concept. 

Please note it is a requirement of this project to have a working phone number and proof of concept speech-to-text and text-to-speech chatbot sending a text message as output at the end of the call. I can provide the hosting, Twilio account and phone number etc.

Thanks - I really appreciate your time and consideration.

We are seeking an expert in natural language processing (NLP) regression and AI, to create an accurate model with low error rate on test data, the data involves an excel with text to price construction data, I will give you an example : 
"m². Demolition of ceramic or concrete tile roof, by manual means, according to NTE/ADD-3 : 100€". 

-First you must know what I have tried, I tried different methods as vectorization (tfidf, bert, etc) of the text data, tree regressors, fine tuning hugging face models, etc. So where's the problem ? The model is of course very good with train data and has very low error, with 0.8 r2 score, but with test data r2 is negative, so it is not accurate when generalizing with new text data.

-Your objective is, to develop a model that is able to generalize well when predicting test/validation data prices of textual data that is not exact but similar relating to the train data, as you have seen in the example, in test data, the text can vary, and it is not exact, because people can add subtle variations, so the objective, Is more focused on nlp techniques to understand similitudes on the train/test data, etc, and testing this with a model to see if you get good results. I can also give you the models I used to test.

-The data is in spanish, I have an excel with thousands of rows, but I will provide you with just an example of this excel, I will give you the train excel and the test excel.
I will also give you the code to read this excel as a starting point.

-So now I will specify the conditions for the payout, I will pay you with no hesitation only if you archive the desired result, the approximate desired result is : 
             -high r2 score, bigger than 0.7
             -at least, 90% of mae errors, must be within 30% deviation, what that means is that 90% of the time, if the y_test price is 100€, 90% of the predictions must fall in the range of less than 130€ or more than 70€, maybe it is a little hard to understand, but to resume, price error must be very low, but there is a margin of 30% of error allowed.

-The metrics are not 100% exact, If you get very good results, I will evaluate this and if you did a very good job, you will get aproved, If you do a fantastic job, I will pay an extra bonus.

-One more thing, the data I will give you, is only a part of all the data, I have maybe 20000 rows, but I will give you 1000 rows, so once you get good results, I will test your model with all my data, and check if your model or code gets the desired results specified before, if not, we can iterate more to get better results, but unless the model is not good with all the data, the payout cannot be made, only a part of the payout could be made in case you make a very good job.

-Only apply, if you think you have the required persistence and skills to do it, as I have tried a lot of things and I know it is hard, but I must say I'm not and nlp expert, so you probably can do better.

Best regards

Description:
I’m looking for a creative, experienced AI specialist to help me build and understand a multi-agent AI ecosystem for my startup. Initially, I want to start small by creating multiple chat-based “agents” (likely using ChatGPT) for different aspects of my business. Over time, I’d like to expand this setup to include more advanced integrations, such as LangChain, and ultimately develop a highly automated, AI-driven workflow.

What I’m Looking For:
	•	Technical Proficiency: You should be comfortable with ChatGPT, AI agent orchestration tools, and be knowledgeable about LangChain or similar frameworks. Experience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or vector databases is a plus, but not required right away.
	•	Teaching Skills: I’m looking for someone who can guide me through the process. I’m proficient with ChatGPT and technology in general, but I’m not deeply technical. You should be patient, communicative, and able to explain complex concepts simply.
	•	A Passion for Thinking Differently: I value innovative problem-solvers who can help me approach workflows and automations in new ways. I’m not looking for a cookie-cutter solution—I want to explore and learn what’s possible.
	•	Portfolio or Demonstration Video: Preference will be given to candidates who can provide a short video demonstrating a past project they’ve built—showcasing how you integrated multiple AI agents, used LangChain, or automated tasks with AI. This can be a screen recording with a voiceover explanation.

Responsibilities:
	1.	Initial Setup: Help design and configure multiple AI “agents” (e.g., separate chats or integrated solutions) for different facets of the business (operations, marketing, development support, etc.).
	2.	Integration Roadmap: Develop a phased plan to move from simple chat-based agents to a more complex workflow that might include LangChain and other advanced tool integrations.
	3.	Tutoring & Guidance: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and live tutoring sessions (via Zoom or similar platform) to teach me how to manage, update, and maintain these workflows independently.
	4.	Ongoing Support: Offer guidance on best practices, potential tools, and upgrades as needed.

To Apply:
	•	Please briefly describe your experience with AI agents, ChatGPT, and any relevant frameworks (like LangChain).
	•	Mention your experience in teaching or tutoring non-technical individuals.
	•	Include a link to a short video demonstration if possible. This can be a new recording or something you’ve prepared previously.

This is an exciting opportunity for someone who loves to think outside the box, build intuitive AI workflows, and empower a founder to become more self-sufficient in managing them. I look forward to collaborating with you!

We have a number of CSV files that are well-structured (labelled columns and rows) that we want to put into a Chat-GPT for our small company, but have no experience with "prompt engineering" to take that raw data and create Pivot tables in Excel where we don't have to use the complex field names in the columns to have that conversation with ChatGPT.  So once it's setup with the correct prompts, we can use Chat-GPT conversation to ask it "tell me total sales for 2024" in a pivot table where it's shareable with the other 2 or 3 people in the company.   We have a new Chat-CPT Team setup, but just no experience or time (I own the company) to do this. Looking for a much younger person with some building expertise with Chat GPT 4 and MS Excel (not sure of what model version we should use for Excel and pivot table work), but 4.o seems to be ok, but I don't know what to ask for, if you will. I would like to stay away from Microsoft Copilot for Excel if at all possible...had a negative experience with that a couple of months ago.. chatGPT seems to be easier to deal with.

I am using Claude and GPT 4o to create good content, primarily for LinkedIn posts and blog posts.

I have set up Claude Projects with all the custom information already inputted and it's doing a great job.

My goal now is to automate the process of not just content creation, but also content ideation and planning, as well as an automation that puts each piece of content into a workflow for approvals, drafts, edit stage, and publish stage. I'm open to ideas on this, but currently it's all handed in Google Sheets with drop down options as data validation, showing the stage of content creation and approvals.

My goal with this is to create at least 30 pieces of great content every week, in various LinkedIn post formats such as carousels, text posts, and video scripts. I need either Claude or GPT 4o to output in those formats on some kind of rotation so we have a variety of post types.

I need an expert AI and automation specialist who can set this up for me, optimize it, make recommendations on how to best ideate new content ideas in an automated way, and how to improve the current prompting and projects set up I've already created.

This project is a priority and I need to hire somebody fast.

Specifically, this is much more about automation and AI, so you don't need to have content creation skills, but your tech skills must be proven.

Thanks.

Looking to hire a machine learning/AI developer to create a model for assigning unallocated jobs to six technicians across a region. The system should automate the scheduling process for a month's worth of jobs, creating the most efficient schedule by considering technician locations, job requirements, travel distances, and job urgency.

Job Assignment Logic:
- Retrieve unassigned jobs from a dataset (JSON file provided initially for development, later will be retrieved from a webhook).
- Assign jobs to one of six technicians based on:
- Technician’s designated work area.
- Job type and technician skill set (e.g., specific certifications).
- Travel distance to the job location.
- Job urgency and due date.

The AI model must provide detailed reasoning for each assignment. For example:
- "This job was assigned to Technician A because it is closest to their current location and matches their skill set, minimising travel time and ensuring timely completion."
- "Job B was rescheduled to tomorrow to group it with other jobs in the same area, reducing overall travel time by 20%."
- Include the justifications in the output alongside the job assignments.

- Group jobs geographically to minimise travel time.
- Prioritise urgent jobs for earlier scheduling.
- Avoid overloading technicians while ensuring balanced workloads (e.g., ~15 jobs/day).
- Allow the system to reprioritise jobs dynamically when high-priority tasks are added.
- Include buffer times to account for travel and unforeseen delays.
- Provide a structured output mapping jobs to technicians with reasoning for each assignment.
- Ensure the output can be seamlessly integrated into a React-based front-end application.
- Use historical scheduling data (manually sorted jobs) to train the machine learning model.
- Ensure the model learns and improves over time with new data.

Deliverables:
- A fully trained AI model capable of:
- - Assigning unallocated jobs to technicians optimally.
- - Providing detailed reasoning for each decision to validate 
      the optimisation.
- Documentation including:
- - How the model works.
- - How it reasons about decisions.
- - How to retrain it with new data.
- - A clear integration plan for connecting the model’s output to 
     the existing React front end.

-- Are you interested in working in the fast-paced, growing industry of <span class="highlight">Artificial</span> <span class="highlight">Intelligence</span>?

-- Are you passionate about Direct Response marketing (email marketing, conversion rate optimization, paid media) and driving RESULTS through your campaigns?

-- Are you excited to move away from typical direct-response businesses (selling supplements, eBooks, financial advice, etc) and work in a business with integrity?

Then you might be a fit for our Direct Response Marketing Director position at Emerj <span class="highlight">Artificial</span> <span class="highlight">Intelligence</span> Research.

** The Opportunity **

At Emerj (namely, emerj.com/plus), we offer subscription research and market research reports to AI consultants and enterprise leaders.

<span class="highlight">Artificial</span> <span class="highlight">intelligence</span> is already massive, with many of the world's most valuable companies being AI firms (NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, etc) - and as AI takes off, more and more of America's 1MM+ consulting companies will need to transition into AI consulting firms. We have had hundreds of them buy our products, and we want to expand that to over 1 million over the coming 5-10 years. There's a big business to build here.

** What You'll Be Doing! **

This role is all about driving revenue, molding a great product, and developing your key marketing skills through direct coaching and guidance from (a) Emerj's CEO (who previously grew and sold another multimillion dollar subscription business https://www.forbes.com/sites/elainepofeldt/2017/04/29/learn-how-one-millennial-sold-a-tiny-niche-business-for-1-million-plus/), and (b) outside Emerj advisors (including multiple 8-figure subscription business founders).

Key areas of responsibility include:

-- Setting up our eCommerce dashboards and metrics that we will be tracking (Everything from conversion rates, webinars, landing pages, and workflows).

-- Getting a look at our actual buyers and start planning out content and offerings that get them excited to spend money with us.

-- Creating and promoting the content in specific offers and promotions (driving sales with your direct response marketing skills).

-- Working in conjunction with organic outreach and the newsletter to get these conversion rates up as well

-- Plan out a system to scale up the conversions once the planned campaigns are in place

** Maybe We Can Scare You Off **

If you fit any of these criteria, this role is definitely not a fit for you:

-- You have never held responsibility for making sales with copywriting, email marketing and/or PPC skills

-- You don't know how to write an email or landing page that converts opt-ins and buyers

-- You like to be told what to do, and have a hard time managing your own time and finding your own pathways and strategies to reach a result

** Interested? **

If you made it past the "scare-away" criteria, and you've got the experience we're looking for - we'd love to connect!

BONUS points to you if: The first time you connect with us by phone you mention something you learned in our short product tour video (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kcsnql0XX9bt7ZhwcMAf7YInIPdWbrX3/view?usp=sharing).

I am looking to create an AI that impersonates a cartoon character. This character will analyse photos uploaded by a user and responds in the same way the cartoon character would. This cartoon character is to respond through talking not through messages. I also wish for this character to be able to read texts sent and respond as well.

The character is Rick from Rick and Morty.

Rick will be animated and respond to messages via voice whilst also analysing photos and either roasting (insulting) or complementing these photos in the same way that Rick would using his personality.

The bot must have the same personality as Rick, for example I would like rick to burp quite frequently throughout sentences as that is a part of his personality. The voice must also be the same as Rick from the show.

I would like each analysis of a photo to be between 5-15 seconds long (a little more or less is fine).

The animated Rick will also mouth the words he is saying and shows off facial expressions.

I would like the bot to also be able to joke around, for example Rick is a known alcoholic so making jokes about being an alcoholic in a “Rick” style.

There is a lot written but I did this for your clear understanding

Sample:  I want an AI toll similar like https://ongo.ai/ 
with good animations like a cartoon character video. 

Timeline: 24 hours

Our solution is an innovative software platform designed to simplify complex processes and elevate knowledge management to the next level. Built on a flexible and dynamic structure, our semantic database allows businesses to tackle complex data challenges with ease.

Our platform empowers teams to rapidly develop applications for specific business processes, even when data structures are unknown or frequently changing. It seamlessly integrates into broader architectures while supporting multiple processes independently, ensuring agility and efficiency in dynamic environments.

What sets us apart is our ambition in requirement and knowledge management—our platform enables smarter, more efficient work by ensuring knowledge is always accessible and deployable. Our platform is widely used in civil engineering, maritime projects, utility construction, and the public sector, where we collaborate with engineers, project teams, and government organizations to model, optimize, and innovate processes.

We are now looking to prototype AI-driven enhancements, including natural language querying and chatbot integration, to take our solution even further.

Within our platform users already benefit from advanced search capabilities. We utilize ArangoDB as our database. We do not only use the ArangoDB models elements/structures but we added also our own. Now we are exploring new AI applications to enhance our offering.

We are looking to develop a proof of concept with a focus on:

Enabling users to ask questions in natural language and retrieve relevant data.
Integrating a chatbot to guide users and provide contextual advice.
Creating a framework that allows us to use a base AI model per client, which can be further customized, avoiding the need to start from scratch for every implementation.

The biggest issue we see is translating the prompt to usable AQL query.
Currently we think that we can use the same techniques as for creating the AQL query for translating the result JSON back to a readable answer. 

We are curious to hear from developers who have experience with ArangoDB (knock-out) and have experience building prototypes or proof of concepts involving AI, database systems, and chatbot integration.

Based on your experience, could you provide a timeframe and cost estimate for developing such a proof of concept? Ideally we have a MVP in the first week of January.

We are looking for someone who can think flexibly and quickly deliver a functional prototype for evaluation.

About Us: 

glimp.co.nz (built on Ruby on Rails ) is a comparison website in New Zealand that helps users compare energy, broadband, mobile phone plans, and more. We aim to provide accurate, up-to-date information to help users make informed decisions.

What We’re Looking For: 

We are exploring a cutting-edge AI-driven solution to scrape real-time energy pricing from our partner websites dynamically. Our goal is to build a resilient, scalable system that can adapt to changes in our partners' website structures without requiring constant manual intervention.

Key Challenges:

Dynamic Website Changes:.

With 13+ potential partners, any website design or layout changes could break static scraping solutions. We need a more robust and intelligent system that can adapt in real time.

User Interaction Flow:

Users input their parameters on glimp.co.nz (e.g., address, usage type, household details).

Parameters are submitted, and the solution retrieves relevant plan information from partner websites.

Scalability:

Each of these agents should work asynchronously, retrieving and aggregating pricing data from multiple partner sites on demand.

Proposed AI-Powered Solution:

Dynamic AI Agents:
Utilize AI to:

Parse website content dynamically without hardcoding references to specific layouts.
Input user parameters into partner websites, submit forms, and retrieve results.

Output Requirements:
The system should return relevant plan information in JSON format, including:

- Plan name.
- Pricing (daily fixed charges, per kWh charges, etc.).
- Terms and conditions or other provided details.
- API Integration:
- Each AI agent should be activated via an endpoint, receiving user parameters and returning the retrieved data. This allows seamless integration with glimp.co.nz.

* See attached image for the page where information would eb extracted from https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/ )

Key Questions to Address:

Feasibility:

Can an AI-driven solution effectively and reliably scrape real-time data under these constraints?

* We currently run over 11k energy comparisons monthly

Cost Estimates:

What are the estimated costs for running the AI agents? (e.g., Large Language Model usage fees or cloud compute costs).
Is this cost scalable as user demand grows?

Maintenance and Improvements:

Can the solution be designed for ongoing maintenance and improvements?

Will you handle maintaining/updating these agents over time as partner websites evolve?

Deliverables:

Proof of concept:

Develop a prototype agent for one partner website to demonstrate feasibility. (eg: https://www.genesisenergy.co.nz/ )

Scalable solution:

Develop agents for all partner websites, working asynchronously.

API endpoints:

Build and document endpoints for activating the agents with user parameters.

Maintenance:

A plan for maintaining, monitoring, and improving the agents.

Ideal Candidate:

Proven expertise in web scraping, AI agents, and data extraction.

Experience with dynamic websites and form submission.
Understanding of AI/ML models for adaptive scraping.
Familiarity with API development and integration.

How to Apply:

Please include:

A brief outline of how you would approach this project.
Examples of similar projects you’ve worked on.
Estimates for costs (development, running costs, and maintenance).

Answers to the feasibility and scalability questions above.

We’re looking forward to exploring innovative solutions to improve our platform. If this sounds like a challenge you’d enjoy, we’d love to hear from you!

Looking to finish this in a few days. If you can't do that don't apply. 

The training data we will use for fine tuning is not that much. Probably less than 5gb. 

This is just what I could think of in terms of how I want to approach the problem. If there is a better way to get the same results feel free to let me know.

I just a need an autonomous AI agent to manage X accounts. I'm a former dev. I can use a CLI to train the agent's specific personality and objectives. The agent needs to be able to create content intelligently, respond to comments/mentions/DMs, analyze performance, and engage the community.  I will provide you with the agent's handle and API keys. It should also be able to DM me with any questions or requests as its human surrogate. 

You should already have this built and be able to deploy it quickly. I'm paying $5,000 for the work you've already done. Nothing I need is very bespoke. I will provide an AWS account. I'll make everything as easy as possible. If it goes well, I'll keep paying you a flat rate per agent, even if it takes you 5 minutes to deploy. 

Bonus if it can connect to other social media platforms.
Mega bonus if it can manage it's own Solana or Ethereum wallets.

I’m looking for a developer to help create and integrate an AI-powered audio translation and closed captioning feature into my company’s webcasting system (which runs on my.webcaster4.com).

Here’s what we’re looking for:
* A widget similar to KUDO or Interprefy’s technology. (We’ve used them before, but their high costs and branded interface aren’t ideal for our Fortune 100 clients.)
* The ability to mimic the speaker’s tone, ensuring the audio sounds natural rather than machine-generated.
* A system capable of learning and adapting, particularly for correct spelling.

We previously worked with a web development company on this, but after 8 months, significant issues remain unresolved. It’s become clear that this project may require more specialized expertise, which is why I’m here.

If this aligns with your capabilities, I’d love the chance to discuss further. 

Thank you!

We are seeking an experienced professional to develop a formula for calculating overall product payload dimensions (in both Liters and LxWxH (in.) given certain data input. We are open to using self-learning AI or using traditional methods like Excel.

An example of this would be, if a customer has a product payload that measures 2x2x1", and wants to put 6 of them together in a single cooler, the formula needs to calculate the total payload size based on quantities (arranged using the most optimal configuration in the smallest space) to fit into a thermal cooler. Vice versa, if a customer wants to put qty 1x product that is 8x8x2 and qty 3x of 1x1x3, the calculator will arrange the configuration in a way where it uses the smallest amount of payload space (e.g. like someone would do with a suitcase).

This formula will help us determine which thermal cooler size will best fit the overall product payload size, including the amount of dry ice (or some other predefined refrigerant size) needed to hit certain thermal performance benchmarks. This is a sales tool to help us calculate what shipper size is needed based on the amount of product they are wanting to ship. Vice versa, we want to be able to tell a customer how many quantities of a product can go into a specific shipper size.

The ideal candidate should have a strong background in mathematics and experience in packaging design or logistics. The formula should consider various dimensions and constraints to optimize packaging solutions for different products.

**Job Description:**

We are excited to announce an opportunity for a talented and innovative developer to join our team in the creation of advanced AI chatbots utilizing the Voiceflow platform. In this role, you will play a pivotal part in not only developing engaging chatbot experiences but also in effectively segmenting and collecting valuable user data to facilitate hyper-personalized re-targeting messages across various marketing channels.

The project consists of two primary phases. The first phase focuses on the design and development of a sophisticated chatbot on the Voiceflow platform. This chatbot will serve multiple functions, including Customer Support, Personal Recommendations, and Lead Generation. However, its most critical role will be to actively engage users and gather essential data, which will be instrumental for our email, SMS, and ManyChat marketing re-targeting initiatives. Your expertise in creating intuitive and user-friendly chatbot interactions will be vital in ensuring that users have a seamless experience while providing us with valuable information.

In the second phase of the project, your role will expand to include assisting us in the selection of the most relevant data points and the segmentation of this data for hyper-personalized re-targeting messages. This process can be efficiently executed using Klaviyo, a platform known for its powerful email and marketing automation capabilities. Although prior experience with Klaviyo is not a strict requirement, an understanding of data collection and segmentation strategies will be essential to successfully tailor our marketing messages to meet the specific needs and preferences of our audience.

The ideal candidate for this position will possess a robust background in Chatbot development, particularly within the Voiceflow environment. You should have a creative mindset and the ability to think critically about user interactions, ensuring they are engaging and effective. Additionally, you should be well-versed in user data collection methodologies and have a solid grasp of how to leverage that data for segmentation purposes. Your contributions will directly influence our marketing strategy, enhancing our ability to connect with users in a meaningful way.

"NOTE:" The first project will be on a commission base only. As we are implementing a Sales Conversion Optimization Process, for each sale, you can make a commission between 5% and 10% (which is negotiable). If the first project is done successfully, you can expect to win between 800 USD and 1500 USD per project.

We are looking for someone who is not only skilled but also passionate about the potential of AI in transforming communication and data collection processes. If you thrive in collaborative environments and are eager to contribute to innovative projects that drive user engagement and improve marketing responsiveness, we would be thrilled to have you join our team. Together, we can create dynamic AI solutions that elevate our marketing efforts and foster deeper connections with our audience. If you are excited about the intersection of technology and sales marketing, we encourage you to apply and share your vision with us!

We are seeking a skilled developer to create a NodeJS script that employs heuristics and machine learning techniques to accurately identify code generated by AI, specifically ChatGPT. The ideal candidate should have experience in machine learning, natural language processing, and software development. You will collaborate closely with our team to refine the detection algorithm and ensure optimal performance. If you have a passion for AI ethics and coding, we want to hear from you!

**Relevant Skills:**
- NodeJS Development
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Heuristic Algorithms
- Software Engineering
- Data Analysis
- Git Version Control

Problem: 

In our industry, a significant number of students are leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT to complete coding assignments. While our current detection tool can estimate the probability of AI usage, we require a more sophisticated solution.

We need a highly accurate script capable of analyzing code written in any programming language and determining, with a high degree of certainty, whether it was authored by a human or AI. ChatGPT often generates overly perfect code, lacking the human touch of comments and less-than-ideal syntax, which can serve as key indicators. This will integrate into our current code and also if it is done well additional work may be given (NodeJS expert required)

In your cover letter or project details, you need to explain how you will achieve the desired outcomes, the estimated time it will take to deliver, and the expected accuracy of your results. For example, if a student used ChatGPT to write their code, we should expect a high probability (around 80-90% or more) that it was generated by AI. Conversely, if a student wrote their programming assignment code independently or by hand, we should see a low probability (under 30%) that it was AI-generated. The higher the accuracy of this script or tool, the greater the bonus that will be awarded, up to a maximum of $1,500.

I need help creating this Chatbot on ZenDesk. 

I tried, but it’s actually a lot more confusing than I wanted, so I need help.

I’d like this bot to give me a simple calculation for an epoxy services website. The bot should get answers to two questions.

How many square feet is your garage?
Do they want their walls painted as well?

Also, it should lead in with the first question to get started. It's only for this quote purposes, not customer service. I'm going to embed it on the webiste 

Based on that answer, the bot should give them a quote. Here’s how to calculate.

$9 square foot for epoxy (flakes)
$1.66 square foot for painting

So a 600 square foot garage would be $9 x 600 + painting their walls which is $1.66 * 600 which equals $6,396.

Before we give them the quote, we ask for their name & email address.

After their name & email. The bot will give them the answer of $6,396.

Then this way, they get the quote, we capture customer information in ZenDesk and we can figure out what to do from there for marketing, customer service, etc. 

I'll need a bunch more help for zendesk as I go along as well. 

If I select you, i'll get you access. let me know in as few words as possible why you think yuo can get this done. any real life examples is best on Zendesk.

Hello, 

I’m looking to put together a Christmas present for my family which involves some past Christmas photos and a short story that will be turned into an AI video accordingly. 

I would like to know how long it would take and how much it would cost for you to create this video for the prompt down below and the 3 pictures that are attached. 

Thank you in advance for your interest. 

Best, 

Story prompt: 

Finally, it is that time of the year again, cold but warm because loved ones are around, snowy but peaceful because of the quietness of the empty streets, and finally dark skied, but light because of the white color. 

“It’s almost time” my mom shouted walking through the hallway. “We’re going to be exchanging presents soon, hmm in about 6 hours so, are you guys ready? Do you need to do some last-time shopping?” My dad and I laughed at each other because it was mom’s typical question every year about the number of presents she wanted to see below the huge tree we decorated with a ton of ornaments. 
It’s always lovely to hear her voice echoing in our house. It’s familiar and it’s like a hymn for both my dad and me, so just like every year I answer “No, Mom we’re good, there are literally 3 or 4 presents for each of us here, so they should be more than enough, don’t you think? And she always says “if you say so, that’s what it is boss”. 

All of a sudden, while I was fixing the last bit of the tree decorations, my cats came running straight onto the tree and all I see is a bunch of ornaments falling off the branches, scattering all over the living room and I heard my mom scream “Nooooo, again?” and I burst out laughing and started to putting the ornaments right back on the branches… 

Oh, how I love Christmas time each year…Those screams, my family, my pets, my house. I couldn’t be more grateful to be with family each year celebrating the holidays :)

I'm looking for a development team to create me a simple version of an OHM (OlympusDAO) fork (see link at bottom for example) with monetary policy that's decided on by an AI agent.

Planning to do this on Solana.
So would need a 2-pronged development approach:
- the basic smart contract functionality - launching a token, having staking and rewards, bonding functionality
- a website UI that allows people to interact with the smart contracts (stake/bond/claim token rewards)
- an AI agent that can be trained to make decisions based on the economy and express in words what changes they are making and why - this can be rather gimmicky. We can train it pretty simply to begin with, and we as the humans can just implement the policy based on what the AI tells us using a dashboard - later integrating the AI to actually interact with the smart contracts.
I want something very basic initially (what I've outlined above but no extras) as time of delivery is important. Following that, we'd create extra projects to build out the product with more advanced functionality.

While I said OHM fork above, I want a simplified version. This: https://retardedapr.com/ is better representative of the functionality I'm looking for.

Timeframe is important as things move fast in crypto. If you could provide me with a very rough quote (fixed delivery amount) and timeline I'd appreciate it, and we can talk further from there.
Budget is flexible, and fully funded.

Looking to start within a week.

I own a ghostwriting business where we interview clients over several months. The process generates transcripts exceeding 200 pages, which are often filled with redundancies due to natural repetition in speech. Before we send the content to our writing team, a human editor manually reorganizes the transcripts, removing redundancies and arranging everything chronologically.

The main challenge is the sheer volume and repetitiveness of the transcripts, making them difficult to manage. I’m looking for an efficient way to use AI or other tools to streamline this process. Ideally, I want to:

Identify and remove repetitive content.
Organize the transcripts thematically or chronologically.
Handle the large file size effectively (since many AI tools struggle with lengthy text).
Are there AI tools or workflows capable of tackling such large and complex documents? Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

If interested, give me some sense for how you would solve before I take a call.

For now, the main goal is to build a private tool that allows me to upload police and legal documents, have the AI read and understand them, and rewrite them into final reports—essentially replicating what I can do with ChatGPT but with strict security and privacy. This is a personal, self-funded project, so affordability is key. In the future, I’d also like to explore creating a cloud-based, CJIS-compliant service for police officers to generate supplements and reports. This would be a separate project and could be built on platforms like AWS or Azure. For now, the focus is on developing a secure, standalone tool. If you have experience with GPT-based AI, security compliance, and building reliable solutions, I’d love to collaborate!

We need a quality control software tool based on analyzing pictures of finished parts. 

It is essentially a vision system that compares standard finishing part images to that of the actual produced parts and determine whether the produced are within the acceptable tolerance. 

The finished parts has a 2D pattern. It is CNC milled small items. You can assume it is similar to a logo CNC milled with clear boundary outlining the logo. As the part (logo) is CNC milled, there are tolerance or distortion of the part. If the distortion is beyond the acceptable level, we should reject the part. 

We would like to divide the development of the ultimate solution into stages of development:

1. Pick out bad ones from a static picture that has multiple parts in it and circle the bad ones in the image - doesn't need to be real time, but should be fairly quick in finishing analyzing a shot.

2. Make it real time via cellphone app  (android) or a computer app (windows) and interacting with hardware, like a sorting machine with automatic conveyor and air nozzle.  

Welcome to thoughts and suggestions, if open source solution already exists, also welcome to help us implement.

We are seeking an expert to assist in building an AI-based tool that formats random CVs into a specific template. CVs come normally in Word file (if PDF is possible - even better).

The tool will likely utilize platforms such as Google Drive, Google Docs, Zapier, Claude, or ChatGPT. We don't insist on those instruments - we just need a solid, easy-to-use automated solution, so it can be different set of instruments. 

Your expertise in integrating AI systems and document automation will be crucial. I'm attaching few files - so you can developthe clear idea on how to do it so it can be used then by our managers. We will pay based on the solid result achieved (tested on the other random CVs).

We're focused on the result. Will be testing on few random (differently structured, differently looking) CVs, and we need to re-structure it based on the given template.

What is our regular task we need automation for: we have a specific template for the CVs (a very detailed one), normally we'd like to format one CV manually, and the remaining bulk of CVs to be formatted/structured automatically.

Below are some more specific details:
 - Template. We mean the one pre-structured and pre-formatted CV, so other CVs are looking the same
 - If some info is missing - it should mark clearly that MISSING INFO or something like this, so we request it. Ideally, the automation comes with the list of missing info to be provided
 - further automation could be improvement of texts inside, and some further analysis (outside of this present task)

I need to wrote a paper about the following experiment I ran. I am good at experiment but not at writing. I dont wanna use ChatGPT since all the conference use AI detection tool to catch these kind of stuff. I am kinda in a hurry. Need the first draft by monday. Final paper could be a week or 2  later its fine.  You can just check my github repo for exaplnation and experiments I ran (https://github.com/ashish-saha/Subject_Recognition_Using_LSTM_for_HAR_Dataset). This is what I wrote so far 

Activity & Subject Detection with predicted Sensor Data


I am using Human Activity recognition dataset with by UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) to write my paper. The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
LAYING
STANDING
There were 30 participants and each person performed the activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy s2) on their waist. The dataset has 10299 entries & 561 features divided into train and test for classification purposes 

There are two major problem that we identified with the HAR dataset
Majority of prior research on HAR dataset focuses on activity recognition, but we plan to use to the dataset to recognize the activity and subject performing the activity
There is also very little research on how to deal with missing sensor data. In real life sensors fail thus making it difficult to do any sort of prediction  

Evaluation
    I used LSTM to do both classification. Look at the results here (https://github.com/ashish-saha/Subject_Recognition_Using_LSTM_for_HAR_Dataset) 
        Activity recognition was straightforward 93% accuracy
        Subject recognition was tricky The UCI HAR dataset is primarily designed for activity recognition, not subject recognition. While it does include subject identifiers, the distribution of subjects between the training (21 subjects) and testing (9 subjects) datasets is uneven, with no explicit focus on ensuring uniform subject representation across both sets. So I combines both train and test set and split the data so both train and test have all 30 subjects. I did the split 80/20. The accuracy was 80% which is good since random would have been 1/30=3.3%
               If we look at the subject class accuracy per activity then the picture becomes much more clear. For all subjects its the sitting, standing and laying classes thats causing issues. Since these are stationary activity it might look very similar across all subjects (Look at my github for charts)

Missing Data Simulation
    The dataset is sampled at 50 HZ. So 50 times per second. And out of the 562 features, 345 were related to accelerometer and 213 were related to gyroscope. My whole idea was for a couple of seconds (it could be 1-10 seconds) one of the sensor fails. For example 5 seconds of accelerometer data went missing and 5 seconds of accelerometer data went missing. I used “SimpleImputer” and “KNNImputer” with and without PCA (principal component analysis) to fill in the missing data and then use the model to evaluate. 

    For activity recognition baseline accuracy was 93 %, with missing data the accuracy was 78% and with imputed data with 90 % (not bad)
     For activity recognition baseline accuracy was 80 %, with missing data the accuracy was 61% and with imputed data with 73 % (also not that bad)

I am nearing the completion of my master's degree dissertation in <span class="highlight">artificial</span> <span class="highlight">intelligence</span>. The coding has been conducted in Python and the results are in. What remains is the preparation of a comprehensive written project report.

I'm seeking an expert with:

- An academic background, preferably in <span class="highlight">artificial</span> <span class="highlight">intelligence</span> or a related field
- Proficient understanding of machine learning algorithms
- High-level expertise in Python coding
- Excellent skills in technical accuracy, particularly with data analysis results

I need someone who can provide moderate detail feedback with key points, and who will act as a sounding board for me. Ultimately, I want to ensure my project report meets the technical accuracy requirements set by my university.

My dissertation is as follows:

Abstract
This project used machine learning algorithms to predict residential property prices and price changes in Hong Kong.

The objective was to utilize <span class="highlight">artificial</span> <span class="highlight">intelligence</span> (AI) and existing property data to analyze the factors driving property prices and price changes to predict future property price trends in Hong Kong.

The project used two databases. One was a large residential sales dataset prepared by one of the largest property agencies in Hong Kong. This comprised 159,676 entries containing property sales transactions from 2020 to 2023 from 18 geographical districts. A second dataset incorporated macroeconomic indicators based on the census and statistics department of the government of Hong Kong. The two datasets were then merged.

The merged dataset was then reviewed and cleaned up before various machine learning algorithms were applied. This involved several steps: first, examining and understanding the data, performing data analysis, cleaning, managing, and normalizing the dataset. Then, the merged dataset was analyzed using various machine-learning techniques, including regression, decision trees, XGBoost, MLP and LSTM.

In the end the best results were with LSTM and ensemble techniques.

Additionally, hyperparameter optimization was carried out to the machine learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of the results and predictions.

The machine learning algorithms identified a high correlation between XXX, XXX and property prices and XXX [placeholder]

[However, the study was limited by datasets that were incomplete, included the COVID-19 period and were over a short period time (3 years), and improving the datasets would have been time-consuming and beyond the scope of the study.]

I'm in search of an AI expert to help me create a character who stays consistent throughout different prompts. My goal is to create a "story" around this characters life.

The character will be realistic, ultra-detailed, often times semi-nude and always look like the life of a real person.

I've already got the character I want to use, and want to place her in different clothes and locations, doing different poses and stuff.

However, I cannot seem to keep certain features of her consistent nor get her bust size big enough without faceswapping from a large busted woman. I've been using Leonardo.ai paid plan and its done a great job in creating the character, but keeping bust size, or posing in certain ways I'm finding it doesn't do very well. Then comes the clothing side of things, I feel Leonardo.ai doesn't do a very good job with clothing prompts when using "Image Guidance" as they all stay the same color as the image you want to style from.

I've been pulling my hair out trying to find a way to create a really interesting story based on my AI character.

I'd also like to eventually create short motion videos as well.

Open to use other tools to do ALL of this, as long as I can use my current character somehow.

I would also like to add that this WILL eventually involve ADULT content. So if we can have a solution for that as well than that would be huge!

Thanks

Project Overview:

We are building an AI-driven voice agent platform designed to assist businesses in managing customer calls. Our goal is to create a seamless, human-like interaction for users, where the AI can handle tasks such as answering calls, providing information, transferring calls to the right departments, and ending calls in a smooth, natural way.

We’ve already made significant progress in building the platform, but we're currently facing several challenges that need to be addressed in order to make the voice agent more effective and user-friendly.

The Issues We're Facing:

1. Call Transfer:
Objective: The AI should be able to understand the user’s intent to transfer a call and trigger the appropriate action.
Action Needed:
Implement intent recognition to detect when a call should be transferred (e.g., to a human agent or another department).
Ensure seamless integration with your backend to handle the transfer process and notify users clearly.
Handle this with clear WebSocket events (e.g., callUpdate) to detect and manage call transfer states.
2. End Call:
Objective: The AI should recognize when a conversation should end and do so with a dynamic and human-like message.
Action Needed:
Improve intent classification for ending calls. The AI should be able to identify phrases or cues that indicate a conversation is finished.
Allow dynamic closing messages that feel natural, such as “Thank you for your time, have a great day!” or “If you need further assistance, feel free to call us anytime!”
3. Smooth, Natural Conversation (Avoid AI-like Sounds):
Objective: Ensure the AI speaks naturally without sounding robotic.
Action Needed:
Enhance speech synthesis using advanced voice models like those from Deepgram or similar solutions that allow for more human-like, emotional tone variations.
Incorporate appropriate pauses and intonation, making the conversation sound fluid and realistic. This is especially important when responding to long pauses or complex queries.
4. Ambient Sound:
Objective: Include background sounds (such as phone line noise or environment-specific sounds) to make the interaction more human-like and immersive.
Action Needed:
Integrate ambient sound or background noise options that can be triggered to simulate a more natural conversation environment.
Ensure the sound doesn’t overpower the conversation but adds subtle realism to the call experience.
5. Intent Classification:
Objective: Enhance the AI’s ability to accurately understand and classify the user's intent (e.g., transferring a call, ending a conversation, making an inquiry, etc.).
Action Needed:
Refine the NLP models to better handle intent detection.
Use machine learning models to continuously improve the accuracy of understanding different user requests based on context.
6. Turn-Taking Model:
Objective: The AI should engage in conversation naturally, knowing when to speak and when to pause for the user’s input.
Action Needed:
Implement a turn-taking model that ensures the AI knows when to respond and when to wait for the user to speak. This would make the conversation flow more naturally and help avoid interruptions or awkward pauses.
This model can also help in situations where multiple people are interacting with the AI simultaneously or when there’s a shift in who is speaking.

Our vision is to build and validate the best outcome-focused eating disorder solution that empowers healthcare systems to sustainably deliver exceptional care.

Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses. Over 30 million people in the US and 7m people in the UK will experience an eating disorder in their lifetime and latest figures suggest 1 in 5 children worldwide are at risk of developing an eating disorder such as bulimia, anorexia, or binge eating. Over the last 5 years there has been a 121% and 84% increase in eating disorder hospital admissions in the US and UK respectively, with hospital stays commonly lasting between 3 and 4 months.

Eating disorder services today are largely inaccessible, overburdened, costly and significantly struggle in delivering a high quality service and acceptable outcomes for individuals and their families. New effective tools for healthcare teams to better manage, monitor and treat eating disorders are desperately needed.

We are passionately and diligently working with all stakeholders to solve the eating disorder system crisis. With our solutions that transform healthcare systems, we are paving the way for a universal healthcare structure that enables anyone, anywhere, from any socioeconomic background to access high quality eating disorders care when they need it and through a channel they want to access it.

A team with unwavering energy and passion that faces challenges in pursuit of doing what is right for transforming a healthcare system that is fit for tomorrow’s society.

We are looking for outstanding candidates who are ready to be part of an early stage company that is at the cutting edge of change within the health sector. Joining the Univa team gives you the opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of people impacted by eating disorders all while achieving your career ambitions.

I have a voicechat bot in voiceflow that can be called with a telephone number to twilio (via replit). The voicebot is a series of questions to the user and then uses some NPL responses based on user input (similar to a therapy session). I want a recommendation of another set of tools to use to improve performance. The user experience is currently not good. Reasons 1) latency - too long after user speaks for bot to respond, 2) SSML no ability to mark up voiceflow for better/more realistic tonal speak, 3) accent - voices on voiceflow all sound robotic, no one would believe they are human like. The project is to 1) make a recommendation of tools for a startup project that will improve the user experience. The user is going to call a telephone number, 2) assist me in reviewing/improving my workflow of the voicebot when I have trouble (I am not a coder) but will handle the data logic of the user flow when interacting with the bot.

We are a fast-growing sports technology and apparel company leveraging cutting-edge tools to revolutionize customer experience. Our vision is to combine AI-driven design capabilities with interactive customer interactions to deliver seamless, personalized solutions for sports teams worldwide.
We’re starting with a game-changing Generative AI Mock-Up Tool and building toward integrating this tool into a conversational AI Chat Experience for a unified, interactive platform. You can see what we do at SignatureLocker.com (search for some team stores such as "Mt Lebo" in our search bar). 


Project Scope (Phase 1):
Build a Generative AI Mock-Up Tool that automates the creation of custom team uniform designs, including:
1) Fabric & Style Recommendations: Incorporate AI-driven suggestions based on performance, comfort, and price point.
2) Interactive Design Input: Clients provide their logo, colors, and design inspirations via a user-friendly interface.
3) Generative Output: AI produces multiple uniform design options instantly for Client to Select from and then refine and/or mark up to submit to our design team to finalize the edits. This will save our design team a lot of time by eliminating the initial mock up process and skipping right to revisions. 
4) Deliverables: Real-time 2D designs with the option to expand into 3D rotating models for enhanced visualization (future development).


Project Scope (Phase 2 - Downstream Integration):
Develop AI Chat Bot and ensure the Phase 1 tool is modular and compatible for integration:
1) AI Chatbots: Customers and sales reps can interact with the chatbot for design adjustments, order inquiries, and recommendations.
2) Live Mock-Up Assistance: Enable the chatbot to provide real-time design changes based on user feedback.
3) Sales & Marketing Content Tools: Incorporate outputs into social media assets, hype videos, and team announcements.

I am searching for someone to help me with the following project. I hope you can help me.

I need an APP optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations written in hardware description languages VHDL or Verilog for the AMD Alveo™ U50 Data Center Accelerator Card or similar other FDPA. The app should be as basic as possible, but it needs to outperform the top-performance CPUs such as Ryzen 9 7950x or IntelCore i9 14900K.

AMD Alveo™ U50 Data Center Accelerator Card
https://www.amd.com/en/products/accelerators/alveo/u50/a-u50-p00g-pq-g.html

The app will be used for mining (PoW) activities for the Matrix AI Network project: https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/go-matrix/tree/master

From the MATRIX 1.0 White Paper, the recommended hardware for mining activities should focus on devices optimized for Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computations. These computations are integral to the MATRIX blockchain's Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism and differ from traditional hash-based mining.
White paper link: https://docs.matrix.io/matrix-1.0

I am a community member heavily involved in mining activities in the last years with multiple CPUs. Still, I am hitting the limitations with CPUs and need a performance boost with FPGAs. There is no available ASIC for MCMC computations. GPU mining is not allowed.

How long should it take to develop such an APP?
What are the basic asses cost to develop such an APP?  I need to think carefully about the development cost over the suggested price.

Need to make a Indian Sign Language Recognition application.
This could be an interactive mobile application.

You must have a deep understanding of the various aspects of OpenAI and Azure AI APIs, from function calling and structured output to the use of data_sources with Azure AI. We are looking to use these APIs in novel ways to accomplish the goals of our web application. For example, for the first project our goal is to describe a way of rendering function call outputs in the web application. 

With function calling, the AI provides the parameters for the inputs to the function call (API call). Once the function call is made, the output is directly sent back to the AI. The AI uses this to provide a written response back to the user. The details of the function / API call can be completely invisible to the user.

In our application, we want to render in the user interface the input and output of the functional call, for the user to see these details. For function calling, the function call schema currently defines the input parameters for the API (via the JSON tool definition). Because this definition exists, in our application we can map the JSON definition for the input parameters to various user interface widgets (e.g. a text box or table), for the user to see the tool call input details.

However, the output from the API is not defined. If an array is returned (for example), it needs to be rendered differently to a single value being returned. For first project, 
  (1) we want to define a JSON schema for the tool call output
  (2) we want to define mappings for input and output schemas to user interface widgets

Beyond this project, other projects look at figuring out how to integrate tables, charts and other capabilities into our AI application, using various other plugins and APIs.

Can you help me with integrating gemini and bigquerry. Im a owner of PPC agency designed for e-commerce brands. As part of my work i need to analyze a lot of data for my clients. which campaign is working and which not? did the cost of buying new client increases in the last few days? How can i grow my e-commerce brand using this information? Im working with funnel.io and i have all the data already organize there and sending all the data into bigquerry. what i need now is to get custom notifications based on the data (if AI model can do it based on KPI that's the best) and also give the client the option of asking questions by using gemini or other tool and get answers based on the data. I'm using looker studio for now the show the data. Let me know if its something that can be done.

The project needs to contain 3 steps. First each client needs to get a chat bot like Gemini based on the data of the client. Ask questions and get answers. For example: "what was the cost yesterday? The next step in to train the data based on kpi. For example get insights on how to increase the revenue based on the data. Maybe increase or decrease specific campaign cost. The third step is to get custom notifications via email or Whatsapp based on the ai suggestions. Is that possible?

If you have a proven track record in this domain and are passionate about AI technologies, we would love to hear from you.

I need some help getting a simple chat bot customised on our WordPress site.

We are using Tidio but the problem we are facing is that we want to trigger the chat to open the 1st welcome message by clicking on a button on our page.

But the Tidio API won't allow that customisation (or maybe we aren't clever enough)

The problem is that is not enough to get the attention of our readers. We want the first welcome message in the flow to open as that will get their attention.

We don't use AI, just a simple lead gathering series of basic questions, and if we have to switch from Tidio to another bot then that is OK as long as it is reliable and can be used on our Wpress site using Divi Theme.

Thank you

Available:
UI design on Figma platform
API list, I think it needs more additions

Required technology:
Flutter and Python(django)


Flutter

1.	Performance 
Flutter has a performance edge over React Native due to its architecture. Flutter apps are compiled directly to native machine code, which results in faster performance compared to React Native, which uses a bridge to communicate with native components.

2.	Customization
Flutter offers more customization options for UI elements compared to React Native. This could be beneficial when implementing VR and AR interfaces, which often require unique and tailored design elements.

3.	Graphics and Animation
Flutter has a powerful graphics and animation engine that can be beneficial for creating immersive VR and AR experiences. It provides a wide range of APIs for working with 2D and 3D graphics, which could be useful for implementing VR and AR features.

4.	Community and Ecosystem
While React Native has a larger community and ecosystem, Flutter's community is rapidly growing. There are already packages and plugins available for integrating VR and AR features in Flutter apps, and this ecosystem is expected to expand further.

5.	Compatibility 
Flutter provides better compatibility with different platforms, including desktop and web, which could be advantageous if you plan to expand your app to other platforms in the future.

Python(django)


1.	Rapid Development 
Django is a high-level web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites and web applications. Its built-in features, such as authentication, admin panel, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), can accelerate backend development for your mobile app.

2.	Scalability 
Django is designed to scale efficiently, allowing your backend to handle increased traffic and data as your mobile app grows in popularity.

3.	Security 
Django provides built-in security features, such as protection against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which are essential for securing your mobile app's backend.

4.	Compatibility with Flutter 
Django's REST framework allows you to easily create a RESTful API that can be consumed by your Flutter app, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of your mobile app.

5.	Community and Ecosystem 
Django has a large and active community, which means you can find plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party packages to help you build and maintain your backend.

6.	Integration with Other Services 
Django can easily integrate with other services and platforms, such as databases, caching systems, and third-party APIs, allowing you to add additional functionality to your mobile app.

I am looking to hire an AI Chatbot expert with experience deploying them into Slack and Microsoft Teams workspaces to build chatbots trained on my work with customers and can take basic actions for them.

Ideally, I want to be able to dynamically insert fields from airtable into the system instructions of an AI assistant that is then deployed (ideally by external connection vs. an actual slack app if that's possible) into my customers' own slack workspaces.

Looking forward to working with you!

We need to build an ai voice bot with automations. We have a process in our business that’s called a “debrief call” basically what we want is electricians have to call this AI number and we train the AI to debrief the call ensuring the electrician did proper procederes, followed the sop guides, revenue driven, etc. also give actions per the electrician’s response for example, did you collect a deposit? If the respond is no then the ai will say return and collect the deposit. Then have this data stored with key automations so if a specific answer is triggered it automatically gets sent to the proper person in the office to handle it.

We need a skilled freelancer in AI and process design to help us build a process that will take a group of long-form videos and quickly slice them to create several underlying "theme" videos. 

Note: we do not need a video editor to produce the final video edits. We're more concerned with how we can streamline this process with AI and APIs. 

As part of this project, I would provide a real-world scenario for executing the process. Just as important, however, is documentation and a recommendation for what tools to utilize in order to fulfill this process in the long run. 

Current tech stack. Open to recommendations. 
ChatGPT+
Riverside
Descript


Project Scope:

Transcribe Videos: Convert 5-7 videos into text.
Identify Themes: Using AI, identify common themes in the transcriptions with the "clips" identified from each video. EX: "time savings", "User Experience", etc
Extract clips based on themes and combine clips from the various videos into a new video file organized by theme. This may just be time stamps of where to cut the video footage but ideally we can find a more automated way. Only need to compile the clips into one file, DO NOT NEED TO PROFESSIONALLY EDIT
New Transcription: Transcribe the new videos
Have AI analyze the new theme video scripts to Draft 5-7 LinkedIn post recommendations based on the themes and match the stakeholder's tone for copy-paste use. Bonus: Review prior LinkedIn posts from a stakeholder to match their typical tone and avoid an AI-generated feel.


Budget: We're starting at $250, but that's just assuming minimal scope, meaning you provide the instructions for how to do this process. If you have recommendations that provide more value and entail building an agent, leveraging APIS, etc., we're very open to increasing the budget.

I'm not even sure if this is possible, but here's the situation: We're trying to make short video (roughly three minutes) that's supposed to be sort of a mini documentary on brewing a certain kind of beer.

We captured a bunch of raw video/audio and attempted to put it all together into a finished product. The problem is that the guy doing the interviews didn't do a great job of coaxing the right content out of one of the people being interviewed. Unfortunately, he's the main character.

We ended up with:

1. Some good clips that are solid all the way through.

2. Some clips that are good except for a specific word or two.

3. Some clips where we need completely new sentences.

I've played around with a couple of AI voice clone programs, but they all come out sort of robotic, because we can't control the voice pitch (This includes Eleven Labs, Descript, Merf, et al). We obviously have plenty of sample audio to create this as well as the person's permission. 

We've made two attempts to capture new audio for the guy, but it feels like he's acting. The emphasis is in the wrong place, et al. I need to know if there's anyone out there who can - through AI, audio engineering, or both - make this audio sound natural.

The video is essentially complete except for this, so I'm happy to send the current version and full script to someone who fits the ask.

The goal line here is to make sure this sounds completely human.

I am looking for help with setting up AutoML Vision to my current workflow.

My business is selling second hand clothing through e-commerce platforms. I am looking to automate certain processes to remove errors of manual entry.

My current process is:
- Photograph item through tethered DSLR straight to my desktop 3 folders (profile image, sliced images (python script), closeup images)
- From here, I will then manually input data onto a google spreadsheet on the adjacent desktop screen. The fields that I'm filling in (that I'd possibly like to automate) are brand, item type, colour, keywords (maybe others).

My process is currently very efficient, but I'm looking at building a smoother system to help integrate AI to automate the manual input of data. 

I've looked online, and I'm keen to use AutoML Vision as I'm told that there's a lot more flexibility with AutoML rather than the Google Vision API.

If you believe you help with this idea, please do get in touch.

Thanks

I have a potential project for Browserless.io, making an AI-powered tool for our site.

We're a developer tool used for scraping and browser automation. Our newest product is BrowserQL, which is a dedicated query language. Here's the docs for context:
https://docs.browserless.io/browserql-start

To help make it easier to adopt, I was wondering about having two AI-powered tools on our webflow-based website:

Script Writer - Give it an html file and say what you want to do/scrape, then it'll write the script. We could also potentially have users submit a URL, which we can then access with BrowserQL to return a stripped down version of the HTML

Code Converter - Give it an automation you've written in another library such as Scrapy, Playwright or Selenium, and it'll convert it to work with BQL.

I had a quick play at giving chatGPT a guide to the language and it was surprisingly successful. I imagine with some proper training it could be even better:
https://chatgpt.com/share/673e3ef7-28dc-8004-b8a2-5c993316ebec

I'm happy to use any AI model, it doesn't have to be ChatGPT. If you're able to also work with webflow then that's an added bonus, but if not our devs can handle that bit.

If you're interested in the project, please share a ballpark time and cost, along with any relevant work examples.

Normally, if we do a voice search and say “Hanana”, it automatically coverts it to “Banana”, because it is the closet match. We don’t want this. “Hanana” is a medicine name and we will provide these list of names. The output should be a name from our provided list. If user has spoken something unrecognised or out of our list, then simply print - Item not available.

Sometimes, the system itself confused with words like wear, were, Karl, Carl etc. They all sound the same. Whatever the case, if it is in our list, it should print. If both the names are available, then print both.

A person is required who understands Python multithreading, machine learning, data processing, and image processing using Tesseract.

Task:  
To correct and improve the performance of a Python script (currently 200 lines long). The script functions as an interactive stdio-stdout program. It takes as input the paths of images (formats: ['.jpeg', '.jpg', '.png', '.heic', '.heif']), loads them, scales (thumbnails) them, processes them with Tesseract, and if Tesseract does not find the required text, classifies the images using the Hugging Face CLIP model. Finally, it saves the thumbnailed images in PNG/JPG format in a subfolder according to the results. The goal is to ensure that the script operates as quickly as possible, utilizing all available resources (we are using a VPS machine with L40s), meaning the script should be able to process, for example, 60.000 paths and save the results as soon as possible.

Current issues:

1.  Images are received in different formats with varying color spaces (we used NumPy for a simple fix).
2.  Loading and processing with Tesseract and CLIP occurs sequentially in three stages.
3.  concurrent.futures is used (this may not be the most efficient solution).
4.  We would prefer to obtain a binary executable instead of a Python script, if possible.
5.  The current performance is too slow.

We are looking for a serious person who will solve our problem beautifully and in a short time.

I'm looking for a talented developer that understands the basics of programmatic SEO — creating hundreds or thousands of pages at scale based on data that we have.

We want to use our data + AI (probably Claude Sonnet 3.5) to create unique, high quality, interesting content across a large number of pages. 

However — here's the important part — our data would update in future. This means that AI-generated text would also need to automatically update if/when data changed. 

(For example, if our page says Product 1 is cheaper, then we update our data and the data table on the page says that Product 2 is now cheaper, the AI-generated text that accompanies the table would also need to update to talk about how Product 2 is cheaper.)

While we understand the basics of programmatic SEO ourselves, we do not understand how this auto-updating AI copywriting element could be implemented.

Our data is currently in Google Sheets/.csv formats.

We currently have a C# web application handling the basic version of this tool but it has no AI integration. The rest of our site is on WordPress and it would probably be a lot neater to have this built within our WordPress site too. We could custom build something to handle this or use a plugin, or perhaps a bit of both. 

I have some ideas but it would be great to discuss with an expert to figure out the best way forward.

This project would be broken down into two parts:
1. Detailed conversation (paid) to figure out how to build this
2. Building the project

When you apply, please prove you're human.

Hi,

We are currently looking for engineers with deep learning and artificial intelligence project experience to lead interns. You will bring your industry-level project and guide the interns as they work on it. The internship will be conducted in a hybrid format. Some tasks will involve interns watching instructional videos and following written materials, while sometimes you will set up meetings to provide direct guidance.

The instructional videos and written materials will be compensated at a fixed price. For the 12 weeks of video content and tasks, we will pay you a fixed total of $60. The payment schedule is as follows: Week 1-3 (interview period) is unpaid, Week 4-6 will be paid at $20, Week 7-9 at $20, and Week 10-12 at $20. The time you spend directly interacting with interns will be paid on an hourly basis, with rates ranging from $10 to $30 per hour. This offers a steady cash flow, as you will continuously lead interns throughout the year with the same videos. You will be responsible for creating weekly video content and writing tasks for interns.

We plan to hire approximately 10 engineers from Upwork for various AI production projects.

Interns' Responsibilities:

Interns will follow your project materials for free. If your content is engaging and the project excites them, they are likely to continue with the internship. If they encounter difficulties, they can reach out to us, and we will coordinate with you to schedule meetings. You will meet with each intern three times a week, with each meeting lasting 30 minutes.

Sample Weekly Materials:

An example of weekly materials can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/179WTdiVt_fd6G1aHLLiOxXPN5mS02CwD/view

Virtual Meetings:
Every week, you will record a 3-4 minute video for the interns. In this video, you will go over key concepts and outline what the interns will work on in the upcoming week.

Tasks and Videos:

After the virtual meetings, you will assign 4-5 tasks to the interns each week. Each task should have a corresponding video tutorial. We recommend you record the video yourself, aiming for 1-2 minutes in length. In rare cases, you may use existing videos from YouTube, as the mentor did in the sample provided. However, note that in the example, the mentor did not effectively connect the tasks, and each one seemed disconnected from the others. For the benefit of the interns, the tasks should be cohesive. For example, rather than having the students follow unrelated YouTube videos with different datasets, a well-structured project should have them work with the same dataset throughout.

Application and Interview Process:

The application process will consist of two rounds of interviews:

First Round: Submit your materials for the first three weeks of the internship. We will evaluate the quality of your project and assess whether you are capable of creating instructional videos.

Second Round: Submit a design document. A sample design doc can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCaflEbAO8zmpyRVP-0LgztSqf0CPJKH/view

Internship Details:

Interns will work approximately 20 hours per week on the project.
The project will last around 12 weeks.

All instructional videos should have a script, and the audio should be generated using machine-based text-to-speech software. We recommend using services like Azure Speech Studio:
https://speech.azure.us/portal

All videos must be uploaded to a cloud platform (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), and the links must be shared with us. Please note that we cannot download videos due to company policy, so please ensure they are accessible via cloud storage.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We are hiring on a rolling basis and will stop recruiting once we find the right candidates. 

Thank you.

We seek a skilled developer with expertise in artificial intelligence functional demos for an automated IA document analysis system.

We currently have a Python-based server that you can build upon or integrate with to streamline the development process.

The main thing in this project:
We need to support a wide variety of documents—over 100,000 types. However, there’s a possibility that the client's uploaded document might not match any of these predefined types. To address this, we propose a solution leveraging LLMs to perform dynamic document analysis. This approach would allow a user to upload up to 10 document samples along with specific criteria. The model would then learn from these examples, extract the relevant information from any similar document, and assess whether the document meets the specified requirements.

The objective of the Demo:

Accept documents (images or PDFs) submitted by users.
Implement AI models for document validation,
Automatically notify users about document acceptance or errors requiring correction.

Propvestor is a real estate consulting and advisory firm focused on helping part-time and passive investors invest in real estate assets.   The platform is being created to give investors all the tools they need to become successful real estate investors.  This includes education & tools listed below.
We want to launch the website in phases with the first phase focused on a landing page with educational videos and general information about how we are and what we do.  The goal is to get visitors to leave their name and contact information.

The website is a scription based website that gives investors the following tools below to succeed.  We are open to build this completely custom or develop it on a platform like GO HIGH LEVEL.  We want to discuss both options and learn the advantages and disadvantages of both.  Here are the tools we want to give our subscribers

Website:  Each subscriber will have their own website on our platform as a sub-domain.  We will have a few website templates (that will grow over time) subscribers can use to market their real estate business.  This website can be standard with a few customizations like, contact information, company name, and logo.  The goal is to give them a proven website that converts leads.

Funnel:  The website will attach to a funnel that will capture and qualify lead information and connect to a CRM

CRM with Calendar:  The website and funnel will be supported by a CRM.  The goal of the CRM is to help them organize their business.  We want to make this easy to use.  The CRM will have Contacts, Leads, Deals.  The CRM should allow for some automation of task and attach to Social Media accounts.  The calendar function is important to keep track of appointments and schedules.

Online Ad’s:  These are ads approved by us they can run on Social Media to gain business.  They can run this on their page or use Pay Per Click (PPC) ads.  This are proven ads that show they can convert.  We also want to provide daily content they can choose to repost on their website if they so choose.

Document Vault:  We will have a vault of documents the subscribers will have access to.  This will include but not limited to Leases, Termination of Lease, 48 Hour notice to enter premises, contracts etc..  We will continuously add documents to this vault to help provide value for our clients. 

Property Evaluator Softwares:  This is our proprietary software that allows subscribers to evaluate real estate opportunities.  The subscriber will simply fill in the appropriate information and the system gives them a breakdown of how the deal looks financially.  They will have to log into the website to access the evaluators.  We will have different evaluators for different property types.  We want to keep this online access only.

Contacts & Relationships:  We are always expanding our contacts and relationships.  We want to share our vetted contacts with the group to help them facilitate real estate transactions.  These include – real estate agents, contractors, title company, cash investors, property managers and others

Portfolio Management / Bookkeeping:  Subscribers will be able to login into the website and view a financial snapshot of their entire portfolio and view financials of each property they own to  see how it is performing. The software will rely on estimated value assumptions that can be put in by the owner, but the income and expense will be accurate and they can get an idea of how their portfolio is performing.  We want to allow good bookkeeping so they are prepared to submit information to CPA for taxes.  We want them to also be able to print balance sheet, cash flow statements, Income Statements.  This should connect with CRM to pull relevant information

Profile:  Clients and Affiliates will be able to create a profile and interact with other members of the community.

Posting in the Community:  Clients and affiliates will be able to post opportunities in the community that are vetted by management.  This will help them build their business and from potential partnerships within the community.  

VestorBox: Subscribers can submit vetted deals to the community and create a profile for the property.  Vestorbox should be a smaller limited version of Investorlift.com and Ark7.com.  The purpose of the website is to showcase and market vetted properties to our subscribers and affiliates and not the community at large.

The Main Website (Provestor.co)
The main website is created to showcase us as a community of real estate investors transforming our lives through real estate investment.  We are a movement.  I want the website to be very engaging showcasing who we are, what we do, and the people we are impacting.  The website will discuss of subscription models and pricing and will be the main page subscribers have to visit in order to login to the website.

There will be several user types to our website and not all of them will be subscribers.   Some of them will be affiliates.  Below is a list of user types for the website.

Beginner Investor: The beginner investor is one that either lacks the credit profile to buy property on their own, the funds needed as a down payment for a property purchase or both.  These are clients we will attract through our eco-system.  We want to work with these clients to help them gain what they lack in order to be able to acquire real estate.

Accredited Investor:  The accredited investor is one that meets the net worth requirements of $2,000,000 net worth and can invest in all Propvestor sponsored projects.  The accredited investor may have credit challenges and may not be able to buy property on their own at the moment.  However, most accredited investors meet the threshold for novice investor in the since they have the funds and credit to acquire property on their own.

Novice investor:  We classify a novice investor as one that has the desire to invest but they are not qualified to invest for Propvestor sponsored projects as an accredited investor because they do not meet the threshold of $2,000,000 net worth.  These investors are qualified to purchase their own investments and we assist them with acquiring their own assets to purchase.  These clients are our primary clients

Active Investor:  An Active investor is one that is currently investing in real estate either part-time or full-time.  Active investors may look to become a client to diversify their real estate portfolio or invest with us on a particular project.  Active investors may or may not be accredited investors. 
Another important note about active investors is they may have transactions they want to market to our group.

Real Estate Developers:  We partner with real estate developers to help them sell existing inventory to our clients.  We also partner with real estate developers to build Propvestor sponsored projects.  We get a lot of our inventory from real estate developers.   Many of these developers have stalled projects or need committed buyers before a bank will lend them the money to build a project.  We help developers by bringing our qualified novice and accredited investors to their projects.

Affiliates
An affiliate is someone who is not a client but works with us to help service a client or introduces us to potential clients and/or properties for us and/or our clients.

Affiliate Types
Real Estate Brokers/Agents:  We work with real estate brokers to find deals that make sense for our clients and deals that make sense for Propvestor direct investment

Real Estate Lenders:  Lenders of real estate help our clients qualify for loans, they fund Propvestor sponsored projects and they can also refer potential deals to Propvestor for client investment or Propvestor direct investment

Real Estate Contractors: Contractors rehab and build projects for Propvestor and our clients.  They can also be an excellent source of knowledge and information about construction cost and nuances with construction sites.  Contractors usually work directly with developers and can be an excellent lead or referral source for projects we may be interested in.

Attorneys:  Attorneys are critical to our operation.  In addition to being an excellent referral source, attorneys are needed for many real estate transactions (depending on state), evictions, agreements, etc. 

Title Companies:  Title companies are needed for title insurance. All real estate closings need title companies.  Propvestor uses and refers our clients to reputable title insurance companies.
Some of these companies will be affiliates and some will just be contacts.  The main difference is the amount of access they are grant to the website.  All affiliates will need to be vetted to protect the interest of our investment community.

Social Media
Social Media and content creation is a huge part of what we do.  The goal is to continuously post on social media platforms and drive traffic back to our websites.  We will create funnels for Propvestor to sell our system to others.  Social Media needs to be a huge part of our website.  

Organic Marketing
We want to work on growing our organization’s organically through the following social media channels.  The goal is to attract both clients and affiliates. 
1.	Facebook
2.	Instagram
3.	Linkedin
4.	Tik Tok
5.	X (formally Twitter)
6.	Youtube

We are looking to create content on a weekly basis that can be broken down into short videos.  These videos will give us daily content that will be promoted on all social media platforms.  We need our system to monitor the success of each post and engage with people that comment or show interest.  Moreover, our page needs to advertise who we are, what we do, and where to find us on the web.  The content will cover an array of topics pertaining to real estate, business, life, and mindset.  We want to keep the content broad so we speak directly to our audience.  The goal is to create engaging content that makes people want to follow us and learn more about us online.
In order to get them to leave their information, we are offering a free e-book followed by an upsell offer to purchase and become a member to our site.  This will be in the form of a funnel.  The goal is to capture their email and mobile number.  They will be added to our drip campaign.  We want to incorporate AI into this portion of the business to help develop emails rich with content and information. The goal is to eventually give offers to them and help them stay engaged.  

Drip campaigns will be based on the client type.  Beginner Investors will have a different email drip than novice investor.  We want the email campaign to speak to their different needs and desires.

SMS will be used to communicate special offers and events we have coming up.

Outbound Marketing

PPC:  We want to create a PPC campaign that has an offer and a funnel page.  We want to market this on the appropriate platforms.  We want to incorporate AI here once people accept the offer and leave their information.

Affiliate Program
We want to create a referral and affiliate program that allows members to share our content on their social media pages and promote our products and services.  We if there refer a member or a subscriber.  We will give them a referral fee and discounted subscription membership.  This is a way to spread the word about what we do organically.

Hi,

We are currently looking for engineers with deep learning and artificial intelligence project experience to lead interns. You will bring your industry-level project and guide the interns as they work on it. The internship will be conducted in a hybrid format. Some tasks will involve interns watching instructional videos and following written materials, while sometimes you will set up meetings to provide direct guidance.

The instructional videos and written materials will be compensated at a fixed price. For the 12 weeks of video content and tasks, we will pay you a fixed total of $60. The payment schedule is as follows: Week 1-3 (interview period) is unpaid, Week 4-6 will be paid at $20, Week 7-9 at $20, and Week 10-12 at $20. The time you spend directly interacting with interns will be paid on an hourly basis, with rates ranging from $10 to $20 per hour. This offers a steady cash flow, as you will continuously lead interns throughout the year with the same videos. You will be responsible for creating weekly video content and writing tasks for interns.

We plan to hire approximately 10 engineers from Upwork for various AI production projects.

Interns' Responsibilities:

Interns will follow your project materials for free. If your content is engaging and the project excites them, they are likely to continue with the internship. If they encounter difficulties, they can reach out to us, and we will coordinate with you to schedule meetings. You will meet with each intern three times a week, with each meeting lasting 30 minutes.

Sample Weekly Materials:

An example of weekly materials can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/179WTdiVt_fd6G1aHLLiOxXPN5mS02CwD/view

Virtual Meetings:
Every week, you will record a 3-4 minute video for the interns. In this video, you will go over key concepts and outline what the interns will work on in the upcoming week.

Tasks and Videos:

After the virtual meetings, you will assign 4-5 tasks to the interns each week. Each task should have a corresponding video tutorial. We recommend you record the video yourself, aiming for 1-2 minutes in length. In rare cases, you may use existing videos from YouTube, as the mentor did in the sample provided. However, note that in the example, the mentor did not effectively connect the tasks, and each one seemed disconnected from the others. For the benefit of the interns, the tasks should be cohesive. For example, rather than having the students follow unrelated YouTube videos with different datasets, a well-structured project should have them work with the same dataset throughout.

Application and Interview Process:

The application process will consist of two rounds of interviews:

First Round: Submit your materials for the first three weeks of the internship. We will evaluate the quality of your project and assess whether you are capable of creating instructional videos.

Second Round: Submit a design document. A sample design doc can be found here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rCaflEbAO8zmpyRVP-0LgztSqf0CPJKH/view

Internship Details:

Interns will work approximately 20 hours per week on the project.
The project will last around 12 weeks.

All instructional videos should have a script, and the audio should be generated using machine-based text-to-speech software. We recommend using services like Azure Speech Studio:
https://speech.azure.us/portal

All videos must be uploaded to a cloud platform (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), and the links must be shared with us. Please note that we cannot download videos due to company policy, so please ensure they are accessible via cloud storage.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We are hiring on a rolling basis and will stop recruiting once we find the right candidates. The position fills quickly, so please apply soon.

Thank you.

While using my OpenAI ChatGPT I noticed I could create a bot so I created one for my kid in 3 minutes. However I think it could be better. I’m looking to take this concept and turn it into an app. She uses voice to talk to it and it talks back. She can even change the voice. It shows her pictures and lets her share what she sees. It also creates images for her. The only thing missing is that she can’t select a character or face for it. Chat gpt also limits how long she can play with the bot. I honestly have no idea how I created this, but I’d like to tweak it and make it available to her friends etc.

I need to attend Zoom or Teams calls, but have a set-up where I don't have to listen or speak natively through speaker and mic so I can attend multiple calls and interact when needed.

Ideal: I'm looking for a set-up where I can have audio out and in coming from one computer into a second computer (or specialized device) where speech-to-text is displayed in real-time from what is being said in the meeting. Then when someone starts talking to me I can answer with text-to-speech with a clone of my own voice. Usually, I'd only need to say a few words like, "Yes" or "I don't have any questions", etc. This would allow me to start the zoom on computer one, monitor the text output on computer 2, and type any answers/interactions.

I'm willing to pay for subscription services, I've seen multiple things out there that seem like they could do it like Eleven Labs but I need help setting it up.

Fall-back: If I could at least get the speech-to-text half (audio out) transcribed in real-time. that would be helpful. I'm open to hearing solutions that can

Key feature, this has to work over audio in/out connection to the first computer that is hosting the zoom or teams call with no software installed on that first computer.
